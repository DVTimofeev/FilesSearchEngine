should find a spot as deserted as this at the sunrise line and get a long days sleep we crew can get eight hours ill take the middle watch the men can get eight hours solid each and the captain can get anything up to twelve advice noted its good advice but thats not the program were going to sleep here i told deety what i had in mind when the car is restowed well eat if there is daylight left well bathe before we eat otherwise in the morning id rather hurry through eating and get a bath since you tell me im going to be able to sleep with my husband when im frightened i stink worse and ive been much more scared than ive tried to let on into cold water after eating deety you know better oh ill skip eating if necessary to bathe astrogator well do it my way yes captain but i stink i do well all stink by the time we restow this car and may wind up eating sandwiches in the dark because everything that we dont throw away is going to be inside with us and gay locked and not a light showing by sundown i cocked my head hear something deety our men came back looking cheerful with zebbie carrying jacobs rifle and wearing jacobs pistol zebbie gave me a big grin capn there wasnt a durn thing wrong with me that carters little liver pills couldnt have fixed now im right good but just barely agreed my husband hildacaptain hilda my beloved your complex schedule almost caused me to have a childish accident i think that unnecessary discussion wasted more time than did my schedule as may be jacob i would rather have to clean up a childish accident than have to bury you but drop the matter pop you had better believe it sang out deety jacob looked startled and hurt and i felt the hurt zebbie looked sharply at me no longer grinning he said nothing went to deety reached for his rifle ill take that hon deety held it away from him the captain has not relieved me oh okay well do it by the book zebbie looked at me captain i thoroughly approve of your doctrine of a continuous guard i was too slack it was my intention to relieve the watch i volunteer to stand guard while you three eat then ill guard while zeb eats added jacob we already worked it out when do we eat i could eat an ostrich with the feathers left on he added hilda my love youre captain but youre still cook arent you or is deety the cook decisions how does the captain of a big ship cope ive made changes deety remains astrogator but is now secondincommand and my executive officer in my absence she commands when im present deetys orders are my orders she will be giving them to implement what i want done neither she nor i will cook uh medical officer damn it sharpie all those hours in the emergency room make you the only candidate or does it mmm zebbie does command pilot include paramedical training yes pretty sketchy what to do to keep the bloke alive until the surgeon sees him youre medical officer i am assistant medical officer when you need me if i dont have something else that must be done captain may i put in a word please do chief pilot sometimes you have to let the bloke die because there is something else that has to be done zebbie looked bleak saw it happen does no good to worry ahead of time or grieve about it afterwards you do what you must so i am learning zebbie cook gentlemen ive never eaten your cooking you must assess yourselves which one of you is adequate ouch your wording zebbie and which one is inadequate they backed and filled and deferred to each other so i put a stop to it you will alternate as first and second cook until evidence shows that one is chief cook and the other assistant jacob today you are first cook good ill get busy at once no jacob i explained what we were going to do while you two get everything out of the car deety will teach me the rudiments of shotgun then i will take over guard duty and she can help unload but keep your rifles loaded and handy cause if i shoot ill need help in a hurry then when we restow ill do it because im smallest and can stand up mostly behind the bulkhead while zebbie stands guard and deety and jacob pass things in to me jacob wasnt smilingand i suddenly recognized his expression i once had a dog who theoretically was never fed at the table he would sit near my knee and look at me with that same expression why my poor darling was hungry gutrumble hungry i had such a galloping case of nerves from becoming captain that i had no appetite deety in the pantry back at snug harbor i noticed a carton of milky way bars did that get packed certainly did those are popshis vice and eventual downfall really i dont recall seeing him eat one my husband said i havent been eating them lately all things considered my dearmy dear captaini prefer you to candy bars why thank you jacob will you share those candy bars we understand that they are your personal property they are not my personal property they belong to all of us share and share alike yup agreed zebbie a perfect communism from each according to his ability to each according to his needs with the usual communist dictator on top zebbie ive been called everything from a black reactionary to a promiscuous old whorebut never before a communist dictator very well you may address me as comrade captain when we come across those
