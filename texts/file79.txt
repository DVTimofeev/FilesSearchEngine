up not my business maam nothing you planned to do was any danger zebbie im not sure whether to thank you for keeping quiet or to complain because you did deety you spotted the mistake i am certain you are supposed to advise me captain im supposed to speak up to stop a bad mistake this was not i wasnt certain that it was a mistake until you told on yourself but you spotted the mistake when gay predicted the time to end the explore program then you corrected it by telling her to shift to a tramp abroad so there was never a reason to advise you i let out a sigh youre covering for me and i love you all and im no good as captain ive served as many hours as zebbie and we are on the ground so now its time to elect someone who can do it right you zebbie not me jake and deety must each do a stint before id admit that it might be my turn captain deety im not captain i resigned no aunt hilda you didnt actually do it it is my duty to advise you when you seem about to make a bad mistake you made a minor mistake and corrected it in my business we call that debuggingand spend more time on it than we do on writing programs because everybody makes mistakes janes little girl managed to sound the way jane used to i resolved to listenbecause all too often i hadnt listened to jane captain auntie if you were resigning because of the way your crew treated youas zebadiah did i wouldnt say a word but thats not your reason or is it what oh no youve all helpedyouve been angels uh well mostly angelshummph i cant use the correct words id shock our men aunt hilda i gave you far worse lip than i ever gave zebadiah you slapped me down hardand ive been your strongest supporter ever since zebadiah what you did was worse i know but you admitted that you were wrong nevertheless youve been chewing the bit demanding explanations zebadiah the captain of a ship doesnt have to explain why she gives an order or does she of course not oh a captain sometimes does explain but she shouldnt do it often or the crew will start thinking they are entitled to explanations in a crunch this can kill you waste that split second zebbie brooded captain says frog you hop couple of times i failed to hop captain im sorry zebbie we get along all right he reached back and patted my knee pretty well in the past better from now on my darling jacob said worriedly im afraid i have been remiss too i was about to reassure him when deety cut in remiss pop youre the worst of all if i had been your wife i would have tossed you back and rebaited my hook farce is worse than mutinous its insulting be glad jane didnt hear you i know i know i touched deetys arm and whispered thats enough dear zebbie said soberly captain as i analyze it you made a mistake in sign every navigator makes mistakesand has some routine by which to check his work if youre going to get upset because recheck shows that you wrote down plus when the declination is south youre going to have ulcers youre just under strain from being co weve all made the strain worse but we want to do better id hate to have you resign over a minor error when we caused your upset i hope youll give us another chance captains arent supposed to cry i blinked em back got my voice under control and said all hands still ready for lift report aye captainaffirmativeyes my dear hilda zebbie switch on gays ears he did executetermite creek was gone

she landed herself power packszebbie had a handcranked dc generatorbut heavy work for husky men for endless hours  hrs from zero to full charge you see why zebbie would rather buy fresh charges we had
