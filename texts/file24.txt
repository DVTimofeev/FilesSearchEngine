and cranny and what that would do to gays balance i had discovered that my husband had a highly illegal laser cannon i said nothing merely included its mass and distance from optimum center of weight in my calculations i sometimes wonder which of us is the outlaw zebadiah or i most males have an unhealthy tendency to oby laws but that concealed lcannon made me wonder why not leave well enough alone aunt hilda demanded jacob and god know im happy here but you all know why we should not stay here longer than we must we werent talking about gay deceiver jake and i were discussing reengineering the solar system the solar system whats wrong with it the way it is lots of things zebadiah told aunt hilda its untidy real estate going to waste this tired old planet is crowded and sort o worn in spots true industry in orbit and power from orbit have helped and both lagrangefour and five have selfsupporting populations anybody who invested in space stations early enough made a pile including pop zebadiah but these are minor compared with what can be doneand this planet is in worse shape each year jakes sixdimensional principle can change that move people into another universe would they go we werent thinking of that hilda were trying to apply clarkes law i dont recall it maybe it was while i was out with mumps arthur c clarke pop told her great mantoo bad he was liquidated in the purge clarke defined how to make a great discovery or create a key invention study what the most respected authorities agree can not be done then do it my continua craft is a godchild of clarke via his law his insight inspired my treatment of sixdimensional continua but this morning zeb added corollaries jake dont kid the ladies i asked a question you grabbed the ball and ran uh we heterodyned hilda you know that the timespace traveler doesnt require power im afraid i dont know darling man why were you installing power packs in gay deceiver auxiliary uses so that you wont have to cook over an open fire for example but the pretzel bender doesnt use poer agreed zebadiah dont ask why i did and jake started writing equations in sanskrit and i got a headache it doesnt use power aunt hilda i agreed just parasitic power a few microwatts so that the gyros never slow down milliwatts for instrument readouts and for controlsbut the widget itself uses none what happened to the law of conservation of energy sharpie my husband answered as a fairish mechanic an amateur electron pusher and as a bloke who has herded unlikely junk through the sky i never worry about theory as long as machinery does what it is supposed to do i worry when a machine turns and bites me thats why i specialize in failsafes and backups and triple redundancy i try never to get a machine sore at me theres no theory for that but every engineer knows it hilda my beloved the law of conservation of massenergy is not broken by our continua craft it is simply not relevant to it once zeb understood that i didnt say i understood it well once zeb stipulated that he raised interesting questions for example jupiter doesnt need ganymede whereas venus does although titan might be better mmm possible yes make an inhabitable base more quickly but the urgent probem jake is to seed venus move atmosphere to mars put both of them through forced aging then respot them earthsol trojan points certainly weve had millions of years of evolution this distance from the sun we had best plan on living neither closer nor farther with careful attention to stratospheric protection but i still have doubts about anchoring in the venerian crust we wouldnt want to lose the planet on tau axis mere r  d jake calculate pressures and temperatures beef up the vehicle accordinglyspherical save for exterior anchorsthen apply a jigger factor of four with automatic controls quintuply redundant catch it when it comes out and steady it down in earths orbit sixty degrees trailingand start selling subdivisions the size of old spanish land grants jake we should gather enough mass to create new earths at all trojan points a hexagon around the sun five brandnew earths would give the race room enough to breed on this maiden voyage lets keep our eyes open aunt hilda looked at zebadiah with horror zebbie creating planets in deed who do you think you are jesus christ im not that junior thats the holy ghost over there scratching his belly the supreme inseminator im the other one the maker and shaper but ii setting up a pantheon for the celestial age were going to respect womens rights hilda deety is earth mother shes perfect for the job you are moofl goddess selene good job dearmore moons than earths it fits you your little and silvery and you wax and wane and youre beautiful in all your phases how about it us four and no more quit pulling my leg my husband answered i havent been pulling your leg come closer and i will you have pretty legs stepmotherinlaw these things jake and i have been discussing are practicalonce we thought about the fact that the spacetime twister uses no power move anything anywhereall spaces all times i add the plural because at first i could not see what jake had in mind when he spoke of forced aging of a planet rotate venus into the tau axis fetch it back along teh axis reinsert it centuriesor millenniaolder at this point in t axis perhaps translate it a year or so into the futureour futureso as to be ready for it when it returns all sweet and green and beautiful and ready to grow children and puppies and butterflies terraformed but virginal aunt hilda looked frightened jacob would one highball do
