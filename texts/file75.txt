for the path down were my hawaiian shirts packed i had her fall in behind me inventory clothing jacob shirts aloha do you recall a blue one with white flowers yes i take medium but can get into a small and andrades didnt have this in medium but this one is so small i havent been wearing it hilda youll like itand it will be easy to cut down a steep pitchno place to lose your footing while carrying a gun i wont cut it down jacob your shirt is my first maternity smock a happy thought did deety fetch sailor pants white i recall white duck slacks hilda kicked off her reds stepped into the water thats the pair she wore them one summer while maturing the following summer they were too tight she was always about to alter them but never did jacob if deety likes those pants so well that she saved them and fetched them along i wont ask her to give them to me i will ask her hilda you worry about the wrong things we pooled resources i chucked in my candy bars zeb chucked in his car deety chucks in her sailor pants and what did i chuck in nothing your mink cape if you offered it to deety in exchange for a pair of old white its a deal it is like hell mistress mine that cape is valuta only days ago each of us was wealthy now we are unpersons who cant go home what happens to our bank accounts i do not know but it seems certain that we will never realize anything from them or from stocks bonds and other securities any paper money we have is worthless as you know i have bullion and gold coins and jake has also we each like money that clinks and we dont trust governments gay must be juiced from time to time that calls for valuta such as gold such as mink coats come out of there before you freeze i would rub you dry but that giant termite worries me last night zebbie rubbed me dry why do women have this compulsion to confess it is not a typical male vice he did i should speak to him jacob you are angry only somewhat as yesterday we didnt know about the giant termite and zeb and i considered your guard rules silly nevertheless zeb neglected his duty i meant angry with me for what did you force it on him no he offered ittowel open and ready just as you do i went straight into it let him wrap me and rub me down feel good golly yes im a bad girl jacobbut i loved it dont give yourself airs my darling you are not a bad girl yesterday was not the first time zeb has rubbed you dry well no they have to confess they have to be shrived do you any harm then or now i dont think so im sure it didnt listen belovedyou are twentynine going on fortytwo youve had three term contracts and now have a traditional marriage in college you were a scandal to the jaybirds zeb has been your chum for years both of you horny as goats my darling i assumed what is called the worst and is often the best but jacob we didnt we didnt and we havent so people who pass up temptations have only themselves to blame just one thing my only love if you and zeb ever pick up the matter try not to look guilty but we arent going to ever should it come to pass warn zeb not to hurt deety she loves him deeply not surprising as zeb is a lovable man get your shoes on dearest one and well let someone else have the community bathtub jacob you still think we have zebbie and i hilda i married you convinced that zeb was at that time and for some years your lover or one of them today you have convinced me that the matter is unproven assuming that one or both of you have rocks in your head but i cant see that it makes a tinkers dam either way jane taught me that the only important rule is not to hurt people which very oftenjanes wordsconsists in not talking unnecessarily jane told me that too jacob will you kiss me madamewhat did you say your name wasthat is the toll i charge before a client starts up this bank as we climbed i asked hilda darling what is the animal that eats cellulose but is carnivorous oh two h sapiens and rattus men cellulose sawdust is often processed as food
