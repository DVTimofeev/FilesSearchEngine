want a closeup now deety i hit it and zebadiah bounced us bertie let out a sigh my home i never expected to see it again i knew it was your home aunt hilda said softly because you looked the way we feel when we see the crater where snug harbor used to be but you will see it again surely how long is a tour of duty on mars its a matter of health bertie added lady her bettys health pop turned his head bertie we can bounce and do it again whats a few minutes late for tea compared with seeing your old homestead berties not late yet pop we can do even better that lawn is smooth and the open part is about half the size of the pg at imperial house bertie we can ground my husband added i could make a glide grounding but deety has worked out a better method no bertie said brusquely thanks deety thanks to all of you jake zeb captain hilda ill treasure this day but enough is enough tears were running down his cheeks ignored aunt hilda took a kleenex from her purse dabbed away his tears she put her left hand back of berties neck pulled his face down to hers and kissed him she didnt look to see if pop was watchinghe wasshe just did it pop said deety will you hand me the binox sure pop see something im going to see what i can of merrie old england as i dont expect to see it again either family we are not going back to snug harbor again its not good for us meanwhile zeb will drive and you two are to soothe our guest and make him feel better but remember to wipe off the lipstick pipe down zeb you arent observant neither of our darlings is wearing any being late is not important the party cant start till the macgregor arrives but once berties there hes on paradeand the governor must not appear with eyes swollen and tear marks on his collar we must return him in as good shape as we got him sometimes i love pop more than most and my husband too i used both hands but didnt need to bertie wasnt trying to get away the second time he kissed hilda he supplied the hands therapy took
