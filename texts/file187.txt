had placed herself between the two facing the screamer and was saying in a low but forceful voice pop dont you darei wont bail you out she was reaching for his glasses with evident intent to put them back on his face it was clear that he had taken them off for combat he was holding them out of her reach i reached over their heads plucked them out of his hand gave them to deety she flashed me a smile and put them back on her father he gave up and let her she then took his arm firmly aunt hilda our hostess converged on the row yes deety why did you stop them darling you didnt give us time to
