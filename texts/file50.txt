codephrase should have a builtin mnemonic bug out a horrid expression and just what we need bug out will mean to take us to this exact spot ill program it and post it and others on the instrument board so that if anyone forgets she can read it and so could any outsider if she got in fat lot of good it would do her gay ignores an order not in our voices hello gay hello deety retrieve present

and out hillbilly i didnt give you that answer i tried to look fierce why deety how could you say such a thing i know i didnt well i fess up deetikins a few days ago while you and i were working you were called away while i waited i stuck that in want it erased i dont know how to look fierce i snickered no maybe zebadiah will be around the next time it pops up i wish our men would wake i do they need rest dear i know but i want to check that new program it sounded complex can be by voice id rather work on paper a computer doesnt accept excuses a mistake can be anything from null program to disaster this one has features ive never tried i dont really understand what pop does noneuclidean ndimensional geometry is way out in left field to me its not in the ball park so im itchy lets talk about something else did i show you our micro walkytalkies jacob gave me one theres one for each tiny but amazingly longranged uses less power than a hand calculator and weighs lessunder two hundred grams mass i meanweight here is much less today i thought of a new use gay can accept their frequency thats nice how do you plan to use this this car can be remotecontrolled deety who would you want to do that i admitted that i did not know but gay can be preprogrammed to do almost anything for example we could go outside and tell gay via walkytalky to carry out two programs in succession h  m e followed by b ug  u t imagine zebadiahs face when he wakes up from sun in his eyes because his car has vanishedthen his expression two hours later when it pops back into existence deety go stand in the corner for thinking such an unfunny joke then aunt hilda looked thoughtful why would it take two hours i thought gay could go anywhere in no time depends on your postulates princess thuvia we took a couple of hours to get here because we fiddled gay would have to follow that route in reverse because its the only one she knows then i stopped suddenly confused or would it be four hours no vectors would cancel and but that would make it instantaneous we would never know that she had left or would we aunt hilda i dont know oh i wish our men would wake up i do the world wobbled and i felt scared im awake pop answered his head just showing above the doorsill whats this debate he gave aunt hilda a lecherous leer little girl if youll come up to my room ill give you some candy get away from me
