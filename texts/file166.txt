in that lifeboat to be pirates or i see you at dinner in dresses of any green cloth you can find cut hastily in this style and pinned together no jewelry no cosmetics that show i dont think you can fake this iridescent stuff but that stickon transparent wrapping used instead would show that you had tried the commodore never rejects anyone for failing what she despises is not trying send your answer via dora i cant be your messenger boy i have work to do before dinner now only fortyseven minutes away will the captain excuse me i got out fast i didnt believe for one second that a ship stocked like the dora run by identical redheads could fail to have endless formals in green including this style or close to it by now the twins were frantically consulting their brother via dora and from what i heard him say to pop i thought lazarus would tell them that it was safer to jump ship and change their names than it would be to tangle with the miniature buzz sawbut if dora couldnt fake something that would at least show a hard try he would sell her off as spare parts and install one of those newmodel susan calvin positronic brains that everybody said was the coming thing for smartships i said hello to gay then tried to reach under the instrument board and find the catch by touch i got out of the car in order to stand up in the ships passageway and took off my deliciously indecent dress then i was able to fold bend and staple to open the stowage a saber and a swordno belts gay what deety im looking for two sword belts category should be personal possessions miscellaneous weapons belts for weapons deety they are supposed to be with the sword and saber many things were moved into the land of oz today i heard you all talking about it but no changes were read into my inventory im sorry smart girl its not your fault we should have told you deety ive rolled the dice the curve says that the most probable place is on hooks in sunbonnet sues wardrobe they were i was starting to leave after telling gay she was a smart girl when she said deety your father is calling dora has him on hold through me thanks gay thanks dora pop deety are you still in gay just outside the starboard door can you lay hands on my automatic and the web belt that goes with it saw both three minutes ago will you please remove the clip check the chamber to be sure its empty then bring belt and pistol when you fetch our toadstickers anything for a steady customer i left with belt and sword slung over one shoulder saber and belt over the other so that the belts crossed between my teats and with the web belt with holster and pistol interwoven through the others because it was far too big for my waist this left my hands free to carry my dress one hand being almost clean enough pop said what took you so long i promised lazarus id get this stuff to him on time now im going to have to dogtrot in army blues i told him i had stopped off at the pool hall and playing off the match game had taken a while if youll excuse me sir i have problems too elizabeth wiped me down with a damp towel dried and powdered me and drew my eyebrows and touched up my lashes and clucked over me all in nine minutes then most carefully put my dress back on me ordinarily one does not take off a washable and put it back onjust wear it until you shower it off a drop of water will go through this material like acid better skip the soup place cards showed us where to dine but at two minutes before the hour the hillbilly had not arrived so we were standing lazlor came in sat down in dresses identical with mine and libs perfect fit nothing improvised their brother spoke quietly to them they stood up lazarus was dressed in a very oldfashioned army uniform breeches with rolled leggings a tunic with a stock collar and pops pistol at his side all but pops stuff looked brandnew i concluded that lazarus had had it tailored just as my head ticked twenty oclock a bugle dora sounded attention at least it had that effect on the men and libby so i stood straight lazlor looked at their brother and did so too the wardroom has three steps leading down into it from each of its

closed by drapes we had come in from the other side a drum and bugle dora again sounded a ruffleandflourish the drapes lifted from both sidesand here was the hillbilly standing tall for her and straight with her perfect icecream skin gleaming in flood lights against a background of midnight blue she was so beautiful i choked up doras invisible band played the admirals march as our tiny commodore marched proudly down the steps toward us it could have been the admirals march pop admitted later that he hummed to dora the march played for generals and told her to fake it aunt hilda did
