name or you can use the circuit as a telephone to and from any member of my household or ask teena to hook it into the public system privacy in this mode this part of teena does not record unless requestedin one ear and out the other so to speak shes wiped it utterly while its slowly winding its way into your brain now if you dont like this service teena will deactivate it at once and sometime
