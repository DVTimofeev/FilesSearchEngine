zeb and me at the doors while deety took zebs seat and talked and hilda sat in mine captain auntie had two ideas deety told us to optimize emergency escapes and to work out ways to use as near to no juice as possible the latter involves figuring ways to ground us in strange places without the skill zebadiah has in deadstick grounding i dont depend on skill put in my soninlaw lwont risk a deadstick grounding other than on a hardsurfaced strip youve seen me avoid it twice by poweron just before grounding yesterday i cut it a bit fine i shuddered my daughter continued we have this new program set it by voice for bearing and as many minima as you please our smart girl goes there and attempts to ground she uses radar twice once in rangefinder mode second time in precautionary mode as in bug out if her target is not clear she does a drunkards walk in locus ten klicks radius sampling spots two per second when she finds a good spot she grounds unless we dont like it and order her to try again study that and you will see that you can cruise all over this or any planet land anywhere and not use juice escape programs we must be most careful in saying g a y refer to her as smart girl or the car or anything not starting with that syllable that syllable will now wake her if it is followed by her last name she goes into awaiting orders mode but if g a y alone is followed by any of eight code words she executes that escape instantly i have tried to select monosyllables that ordinarily do not follow her first name gay deceiver hi deety dictionary g a y read gayety gayfeather gayle gaylord gaypayoo gaywings xxiv captains arent supposed to cry hilda i ordered an early dinner by starting it when zebbie and deety went down to bathe i had ready a public reason but my motive was personal i didnt want a pillow talk with jacob annoyed at him at me i had had a perfect chance to keep my lip zipped and muffed it was i boasting or confessing or trying to hurt jacob oh nocan the id be that idiotic dont rationalize it sharpie had not your husband been kind tolerant and far more sophisticated than you ever dreamed you would be in trouble when dinner was over zebbie said lazily ill do the dishes in the morning i said i prefer that they be done tonight please zebbie sat up and looked at me his thoughts were coming through so strongly that i was getting them as words i never allow myself to be close with a person whose thoughts i cant sense at all i distrust a blank wall but now i could hear such names as queeg and bligh and vanderdecken and ahaband suddenly captain ahab was harpooning the white whale and i was the whale zebbie bounced to his feet with a grin that made me uneasy sure thing capn deety grab a rifle and hold it on me to make sure i get em clean i cut in quickly im sorry chief pilot but i need the astrogator jacob is your assistant when they were gone deety said will my shotgun do i dont think the cardboard eater comes out in daylight bring the guns inside were going to close the doors i waited until we were settled deety will you make me a copy of your new programs before our men come back if they take time to wash them properly men and dishesyou know i hope they stall and get over their mad deety finished that too but i intend to write a sequential program and i want you to check me after you make that copy they did stay downman talk no doubt men need us but can just barely stand us every now and then they have to discuss our faults i think that is why they shut us out deety made a copy while i wrote what i planned to do deety looked it over corrected some wording looked it over againand said nothing pointedly deety can you handle your fathers lab camera certainly will you check its load and shoot when i ask for it of course if i goof on an order correct me at once you dont intend to hand this to zebadiah to carry out no i prefer that you not mention that i prepared it ahead of time deety the chief pilot assured me that any of us could command in aerospace i am about to make a test run the chief pilot is in a position to override if he does i shant fight it i have said all along that he should be captain we had time to dig out that shirt with the white flowers deetys sailor pants were long we turned up cuffs the lacing at the back made them small enough in the waist she gave me a blue belt to pull in the shirt which i wore outsidethen she added a blue hair ribbon captain auntie you look good better than i will in this jump suit i am reluctantly pulling on gosh im glad zebadiah isnt square about skin he was when i adopted him fetched swim briefs the first time i invited him over to swim but i was firm there they come open the doors they appeared to be over their mad zebbie looked at me and said
