with one hand the other was needed to keep her from falling as aunt hilda has placed a record in gay by interviewing all of us and combining it i will stick to essentials after the rest had gone home or retired to their rooms we four were invited into the library it was smaller than it had been cozy as glindas girls had gone to their rooms glinda was at her great book of records as we were ushered in she smiled and bowed without getting up as we sat down friends she said doctor captain princess hilda and deety i will save time by telling you that during the dancing i conferred with ozma the wizard and professor wogglebug i had studied the records of your strange adventure and i read a rsum to them before we discussed your problems first let me say that ozma repeats her invitation you are welcome to stay here forever you will find hospitality wherever you go deety knows this and princess hilda knows it too although she is not as sure of it as deety is but to reassure you gentlemen the wizard and i have made the land of oz one quarter inch wider in all directions a change too small to be noticed but you doctor will recognize that this provides ample lebensraum for four more good people as well as for your sky chariot miss gay deceiver a quarter of an inch captain is six and thirtyfive hundredths millimeters while we were about it on the advice of professor wogglebug we made small changes in miss gay deceiver zebadiah gave a start and looked upset gay was his sweetheart long before i was he takes care of her as carefully as he takes care of me but he should have trusted glinda glinda smiled warmly dont be alarmed captain no harm has been done to the structural integrity or to the functioning of your beloved craft when you noticeyou will noticeif you do not like the changes all you need do is to say aloud glinda change miss gay deceiver back the way she was i will read it here in my book and will carry out your wish but i do not think that you will ask me to do this that is not prophecy a good witch does not prophesy but it is my firm opinion now to major matters there are no black hat vermin in oz should one be so foolish as to come here i would know it from my book and it would be ejected into the deadly desert what would happen to it there the less said the betterbut evil is not tolerated in oz as to the problem of vermin in your home world it does not lie in ozmas jurisdiction my powers are limited there while my great book tells me what happens there it does not distinguish between vermin disguised as human beings and human beings who by their nature are evil i could cast a spell over you which would keep you away from all black hats do you wish that pop glanced at zebadiah my husband said just a moment glinda the good just what does that mean spells are always literal captain thats why they can cause so much trouble i rarely use them this one means what i said you would be kept away from any vermin of the sort you call black hats in that case we couldnt recognize one could we or get close enough to destroy it i think one would have to devise ways to do each at a distance spells do not reason captain like computers they operate literally could they recognize us boobytrap us bomb us i do not know captain my book records only what they have done not what they may do even then as i have said the records do not unmask a disguised black hat therefore i know little about them do you wish the spell you need not decide at once if you remain in oz you wont need it i blurted out we ought to stay here glinda smiled at me not a happy smile dear deety you have decided not to have your baby huh i mean excuse me glinda you have been in fairyland more than the others you know that your little girl will not be born hereust as no one ever dies here aunt hilda spoke up so quickly i couldnt get a word in glinda thank you very much but i will not be staying i gulped i wont be staying either aunt glinda so i suspected do you want my advice dear yes certainly having decided to be a woman and not a little girl like dorothy or trot leave here quicklyest you be tempted to stay in fairyland forever pop glanced at zebadiah then said madame glinda well be leaving in the morning we are grateful for your lavish hospitalityut i think that is best i think so too doctor but remember ozmas invitation stands when you are weary of the world come here for a holiday and bring the children children are happy here and never get hurt oz was designed for children we will we certainly will is there anything more to discuss if not  just a second put in aunt hilda you told deetywill you tell me glinda smiled my book states that you are growing a boy xxxiii solipsism is a buzz word zeb i didnt sleep with deety that night i didnt plan it that way a footman showed me to a room deety and hilda were standing at the top of the stairs more magical stairsokay as long as you dont look down and talking excitedly with jake nearby when i saw that the room had only a single bed the footman had vanished i stepped outside deety and hilda and jake were gone the upper hall was
