block it offmy sideburns were missing zeb dressed in a serviette libby long the only one not of our familyand lib used to be male a good time to rub blue mud in my belly button im ready hilda noticed my decision by not noticing it the blue tinkerbell light appeared led us to a small dining room where we encountered a longfamily customdid not realize it because it matched a ceremony of our own lib saw us came over kissed hilda kissed mebriefly but with timestop then my daughter was kissing me goodmorning while zeb kissed my wife we swapped as usual deety kissed hildaand zeb took my shoulders hissed into my ear stand stilland gave me the double latin kiss each cheek did my blood brother think i would let him down in the presence of one not of our family our custom had started after our double elopement while zeb and i usually used the latin symbol four rapid pecks once at snug harbor we had missed the fast timing hit each other mouth to mouthdidnt pull back but didnt stretch it out we declined to make anything of italthough i was aware of the break in taboo and he was too two mornings later i was last in zeb was seated with his back to me he leaned back and turned his head to speak to me i leaned down kissed him on the mouth firmly but briefly moved on and kissed my daughter not as briefly moved on and kissed my wife thoroughly sat down and demanded whats for breakfast after that the only invariant was whats for breakfast zeb and i used either latin pecks or busses on the mouthbrief dry symbolic initiated by either of us it meant that we were closer than a handshake it held no sexual significance so i was disgrunted that zeb thought it was necessary to warn me let me add women are my orientation and hilda my necessity but i tried the other way with my high school chum our graduation week we were experimenting to find out what the shooting was all aboutplanned but date subject to opportunitywhich turned up that last week of school a twohour examination no other school that day a half hour of tennis sudden realization that we were free and that his parents flat was empty and would remain so until late afternoon der tag we gave it a fair trial we bathed first and thoroughly we were not shy or afraid of each other we were not afraid of getting caughtdoors locked and bolted chains on sop by his parents rules we liked each other and wanted it to work total failure got up had peanutbutterandjelly sandwiches with milk discussed it as we ate neither of us upset not disgusted no bad breath or similar hazards but no results brushed our teeth again washed each othergave it a second try so much calisthenics no morals about it willing and eager to add it on not for us so we killed all evidence and got in three more sets of tennis thats how it is with zeb and me i love him dearlybut i love him for what he iswhile fully empathizing that my daughter thinks he is the greatest lover since well the greatest but if zeb ever makes a pass at me i will do my amateuracting best to make him feel that this is what i have been waiting for all my life ive been trying to say why i was miffed never mind i shall make it clear to zeb that i will never let him down
