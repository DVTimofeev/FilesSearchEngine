her doctor i suggested she told on the rest of us how many doctorates do you hold dear seven or eight after the first one it no longer matters of course im hilda betty but bertie we have yet to meet the brigadier i glanced at the tabs of the officer with the aiguillette and booming voice yes a crown inboard and three pips but when had hilda learned british insignia many americans cant read their own i am ceasing to be surprised at how many facts can be stuffed into so small a space sorry friends this is brigadier iver hirdjones squeaky finds things i lose and remembers things i forget ladies gentlemen charmed here is something you told me to remember general the brigadier handed a sealed envelope to his boss ah yes smythecarstairs handed it to my wife the keys to the city maam phrased as you specified each of you nathed and that third factor included signed by me for the sovereign and carrying the imperial seal your excellency is most gracious hilda said formally and turned toward
