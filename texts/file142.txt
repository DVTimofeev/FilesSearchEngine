once who they were captain auntie did too im not sure about our husbands those are nice teatsi can admit it when i see them on someone else its no virtue to have this or that physical asset its ancestry combined with selfobligation to take care of ones body but a body feature can be pleasing to the owner as well as to others same broad shoulders same wasp waist same wellpacked somewhat
