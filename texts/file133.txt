that it had nothing on it but palm trees deety stripped started exercises hilda joined her jake and i set out lunch having first dressed in stylish tropical skin the only lessthanidyllic note came from my objecting to deetys swimming in the lagoon hilda backed me up deety thats not a swimming pool anything in it has defenses or couldnt have survived the first law of biology is eat or be eaten a shark could have washed over the reef years back eaten all the fishand now be delighted to have you for lunch ugh deety youd be very tasty i soothed xxxviii under his vine and under his fig tree and none shall make them afraid jacob teh positive took longer to search than teh negative for the very reason that its analogs were so much like our native planet an uninhabited planet could be dismissed in ten minutes one heavily populated took no longer a planet at too low a level of culture took hardly longer a culture with animaldrawn carts and sailing ships as major transport we assumed not to have advanced medicine but most took longer to reject at the end of a week we had rejected ninetyseven which left us only   to inspect that evening at picnic island our private atoll my daughter said capn auntie were doing this wrong how deetjkins ninetyseven in a week over forty thousand to go at that rate we finish in eight years her husband said deety were getting faster my beloved said astrogator do you know more about calculating than does the copilot zeb shut up we had learned that when hilda addressed usby titles she was speaking as captain i flatter myself that i learned it quicke whereas zeb was a bit slow go ahead deety if we go on checking this way it wont get better it will get worse heres the first weeks scoreshe passed around her summary it read earth analogs checked  average time per planet  mins  sec maximum time  days  hrs  mins minimum time  seconds median time  mins  sec i studied it deety we can reduce that average time over two days was much too long to check analog twentysix no pop we should have taken longer on twentysix its that thirteen seconds that is bankrupting us daughter thats preposter chief pilot yes dear please let the copilot finish without interruption i retired from the field annoyed to wait until my advice was indispensablesoon i felt sure aunt hilda if we gave each analog thirteen seconds it would take us eighteen and a half daysnd we would learn nothing i want to cut the minimum time way way downmake it routineand learn something i wish gay could talk i do but dear she can we can be in oz in two minutes the dirty dishes can wait my daughter looked startled pass me the stupid hat but we wont go to oz before tomorrow we need to figure out what the problem is firstand i need a night of cuddle with jacob for the good of my soul hilda reached out and took my hand hilda went on deety remember how fast we mapped marstau tenpositive once we let gay do it her way isnt there some way to define a locus then turn her loose we discussed it until bedtime i set the locus myself by vetoing going past earthanalogteh positivefivethousand until we were certain that no satisfactory analog existed in those first five thousand family i told them call me chicken to use zebs favorite excuse i know so little about this gadget i invented that lam always afraid of getting lost all rotations have been exactly ninety degrees in theory i can define a quantum of angle and each such quantum should render accessible another sheaf of universes in practice i cant do machining of that quality even if i could i would be afraid to risk  our necks on a gadget required to count angular quanta but i have another objectiona gut feeling that worlds too far out teh axis will be too strange language culture even dominant racei confess to prejudice for human beings with human odo and dandruff and faults supermen or angels would trouble me more than vermin i know what to do with a black hatkill it but a superman would make me feel so inferior that i would not want to go on living deety clapped thats my pop dont worry pop the superman who can give you an inferiority complex hasnt been hatched i think she meant that as a compliment we worked the parameters down to three climate warm enough to encourage nudity population comfortably low technology high the first parameter was a defense against bh vermin they require antinudity taboo to bolster their disguises the last parameter would tend to indicate advanced obstetrics as for population every major shortcoming of our native planet could be traced to one cause too many people not enough planet hilda decided to standardize one locale one haboveg the locale was in earthzero terminology long beach california over its beach one klick habovegdangerously low were it not that gay would never be in any universe longer than one second any speedoflight weapon can destroy in less than a second but can its humancummachine operators identify a target bear on it and fire in one second we thought not we hoped not at analogs of long beach it should be midsummer hot dry and cloudless if that beach was comfortably filled but not crowded if the people were nude if area adjacent to the beach showed high technology by appearance then that analog should be checked further forty minutes in oz changed much of our planning tiktok was waiting for his lady friend as usual but kept politely quiet while deety talked with gayand so did zeb and so did i not because we have
