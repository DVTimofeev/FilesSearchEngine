enough i must report this by definition all of you are missing howards but lazarus thats simply the average on earthour earth now that i know that there are thousands of analogs doesnt matter different universe different time linenot my problem here you are a howard you four and all your descendants hilda smiled happily thats cheerful news to a woman six weeks pregnant you and deety same time and doesnt show yet lazarus i was tempted a while ago to tell you because i was tempted now now down rover outline to me how we rescue a woman dead for many centuries hilda someday im going to get you drunk want to bet never with you there is mystery about my mothers death she appears to have been killed accidentally at a relatively young age for a howard just short of a hundred i was notified as her purse ids named me as next of kinand i bawled like a baby for i had been planning to pay her a visit on her century day july th  instead i attended her funeral flying to albuquerque two weeks early nobody there but me she was living alone under her maiden name she and my father having separated thirty years earlier but apparently she hadnt listed her last address change with the howard foundation hadnt notified her other children howards are like that they live so long that kinship is not enough reason to stay in touch closed casket and cremationauthorized by stuff in her purse i never saw her body but there was no doubt as to her ids and so forth in my world  was a time when you couldnt sneeze without carrying a thick pack of cards all in effect saying that you were you i was feeling it because i was seventy later that year and looked thirtyfive embarrassing i had plans to drive south from albuquerque cross the border and not come back until i had bought a new passport to match a new name hilda it was over two thousand years later in preparing for my first time trip that i learned that my mother was not listed in the archives as dead but simply as record missing the matter troubled me a few years agomy timelazlor took me back didnt ground a missile chased us and scared dora silly but i got a motion picture that seems to show the accident there is a blur on the frames just before the first one that shows what i think is the corpse can you guess the size and shape shant try lazarus as near as i can measure on a film a centimeter square shot with a telephoto lens from too high because dora was crying and wanting to go home it is the size of that berth gay deceiver is in hilda i think i photographed you rescuing my mother before you did it what lazarus thats dont say impossible the land of oz is impossible youre impossible im impossible who invented pantheistic multiperson solipsism you did i wasnt going to say impossible now that you know that im pregnant you will realize why i want to try to rescue your mother right away before my belly starts growing where the seat belt crosses it her name was marian marian johnson smith maureen johnson that proves that the real lazarus long stood up it bothered me that there might be a series of analoglazaruslongs like analogearths wouldnt bother me thats their problem but it would destroy the theory i worked out that would account for my sitting here in a pool of water in a timetravelling flying saucer with a fabulous manboth wayswhen i know hes a fictional character in a book i read years back that makes me a fictional character too but that doesnt trouble me as i cant read a novel with me in it any more than you could read the one i read about you i came close to doing just that dont be mysterious lazarus i like wild stories used to read every one i could find in the kansas city public library on another time trip i picked up a magazine of a type you may never have seen read one installment of a serial ridiculous four people traveling in space in an airplane at the end of that installment they are hailed by a flying saucer continued next month hilda how do you think dora was able to be at the right place at the right time when gay deceiver popped out of nowhere where is that magazine down the same destruction oubliette that recently received my best fake scottish
