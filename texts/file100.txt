arranged the exchange moresby hasnt been here long im still learning his quirks no excuse captain but i offer it in extenuation lets forget it bertie you used reconnaissance where i would have said joy ride reconnaissance is a military term did you use it as such i did gay deceiver is a private yacht and i am a civilian master she looked at me chief pilot will you advise me captain if we overfly territory for the purpose of reconnaissance the act is espionage governor is this room secure hildacaptain in what way is it soundproof and are there microphone pickups it is soundproof when i close

governor if you dont want to trust us tell us to leave smythecarstairs had been standing since turning the rug to remove the switch he looked down at hilda and smiled captain you are an unusually small woman and the toughest man ive dealt with in many a year the situation is this the russians have sent another ultimatum we have never worried about russians as we settled halfway around the planet from them and logistics here are almost impossible no oceans no navigable streams some canals if one enjoys suicide both sides have attempted to raise horses they dont live long they dont reproduce both sides have ornithopters but they cant carry enough or fly far enough i was startled when you said that they had given you trouble where you had first touched downand proved it by showing me wreckage of a thopter any logistics problem can be solved if you use enough men enough time those russian craft must have behind them stockpiles about every fifty miles if they have the same continuing this way when they get here they will wipe us out is it that bad i inquired sharpie said governor our chief pilot is the only one of us with combat experience yes agreed jake with a wry smile i was awarded rank in lieu of combat i signed papers bertie gave the same mirthless smile welcome to the lodge twenty years since i last heard a bullet say wheat now i may be about to lose my last battle friends my rank states that i am qualified to command an army corps but i have possibly one platoon who will stand and die jake said governor this city must be two hundred thousand people more than that jake over ninetynine percent are convicts or discharged convicts or their wives and children do you imagine that they are loyal to me even if they were they are neither trained nor armed i have a nominal regiment a battalion in numbersand a platoon in strength friends my troops officers and men and my civil servants are with few exceptions transportees quite as much as the convicts example an officer with a court staring him in the face can often get the charges dropped by volunteering for mars i dont get murderers what i do get is worse for me the mess treasurer who dips into mess funds because he has a sure thing at a racing meet the oh the devil take it i dont get villains i get weaklings there are a few good ones hirdjones young fellow named bean two old sergeants whose only shortcomings are that one had two wives and while the other had only one she wasnt his if the russians get here theyll kill our wogsthey dont domesticate them they hunt and eat themtheyll kill anyone in uniformnd transportees will learn that being a serf is worse than being a free man not on the planet of his choice squeaky where have you been in the card room sir first
