them all without trying the name of the egyptian queen nefertiti means both beautiful and good in one word i think that explains glinda she got up from her great book of records and glided toward uskissed hilda first kissed me and said welcome home deety and i choked up and couldnt talk i just curtsied she offered a hand each to zebadiah and pop they bowed simultaneously and kissed her hands she waved at chairs that hadnt been there and invited us to sit down zebadiah whispered you seem to own this place not really i whispered back but ive lived in oz longer than anywhere elsemama and pop lived at several campuses while i was growing up but i always took oz along wherever we moved well im glad you made me dress up we were introduced to glindas girls and each one curtsied it felt like being in imperial houseexcept that these girls were neither compelled nor paid when i stopped to think about it i couldnt recall that money was used in oz it didnt have an economy the girls were beautifully dressed each differently but each girls dress was predominately the color of her own country munchkin blue gillikin purple winkle yellow a few in green one girl in redquadling of course where we werelooked familiar i said to her is your name betty she was startled why yes your highnesshow did you know she dropped a curtsy ive been here before ask captain bill im not your highness im just deety do you have a friend named bertie yes your yes deety hes not here now hes at the college of professor wogglebug i made note to tell betty about itomeday i cant tell all about everyone we met at glindas palace there were too many and more kept arriving everyone seemed to expect us and pleased to see us pop did not go stark raving mad when he met the scarecrow because he was already deep in conversation with professor h m wogglebug and with oz the great royal wizard to queen ozmapop was barely polite shook hands and said howdyou do mr scarecrow and went right on talking to professor wogglebug and the wizard im not sure he looked at the scarecrow he was saying you put it neatly professor i wish professor mobyas toras could hear your formulation if we set alpha equal to zero it is obvious that i wandered off because when pop says it is obvious that what is really obvious is that deety should leave dinner was in the banquet hail and the crowd of guests exactly filled itglindas banquet hall is always the right size for the number of persons eating thereor not eating as the case may be for jack pumpkinhead tiktok the tin woodman the sawhorse the scarecrow and other people who dont eat were seated there too and also people who arent human people the cowardly lion the hungry tiger the woozy the king of the flying monkeys hank toto and a beautiful longhaired cat with supercilious manners glinda the good was at the head of the table at one end and queen ozma was at the head at the other end pop was on glindas right and zebadiah was on ozmas right the wizard was on glindas left and professor wogglebug was on ozmas left aunt hilda and i were opposite each other at the middle of the long table she had the tin woodman on one side and the scarecrow on the other and was doing her best to charm both of them and both were trying to charm her and all three were succeeding i had three dinner companions i started with two the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger the lion ate what others ate but the tiger had a bowl of cornflakes the size of a small washtub and ate from it very tidily with a spoon that matched the bowl the cowardly lion and i had just started seafood cocktails when this cat brushed against my leg to get my attention looked up and said you smell like a cat person make a lap im coming upand jumped i said eureka do you have dorothys permission what a silly way to talk dorothy must get my permission feed me the lobster first then the shrimp you may have the last piece of shrimp for yourself the hungry tiger put down his big spoon and said highness may i abate this nuisance dont trouble yourself old boy the lion said ill abite it instead in one bite but please pass the tabasco sauce cats have so little taste pay no attention to those peasants wench and get on with the lobster animals should not be allowed to eat at the table look who is calling whom an animal growled the cowardly lion its not an animal leo the hungry tiger objected its an insect highness im a vegetarianbut i would be happy to break over this once and slice it into my cornflakes shall i dorothy wouldnt like it rajah you have a point maam shall i ask toto to chase it out eureka may stay i dont mind wench the correct answer is i am honored ignore these jungle beasts they are not cats be it known that felis domestica has been civilized more generatio than all you lesser breeds combined as my serene ancestress bubastis goddess of the nile was wont to say where cat is is civilization hurry up with that lobster so i hurried eureka accepted each bit daintily barely flicking my finger tips with her scratchy tongue at last she averted her mouth dont overdo it ill tell you when i require more scratch behind my left eargently i shall sing then i shall sleep maintain a respectful silence i did as ordered eureka purred very loudly as the buzzing gave way to soft snores i slowly stopped scratching i had to eat
