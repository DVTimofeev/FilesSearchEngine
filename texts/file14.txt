ever read about all around was machinery a drill press looks the same anywhere and so does a lathe but others were strangeexcept that they reminded me of machine shops my husband caught sight of us stood up and said welcome ladies zebbie turned his head and said sharply late to class find seats no whispering during the lecture take notes there will be a quiz at eight oclock tomorrow morning if you have questions raise your hands and wait to be called on anyone who misbehaves will remain after class and wash the chalk boards deety stuck out her tongue sat down quietly i rubbed his brush cut and whispered an indecency into his ear then i kissed my husband and sat down my husband resumed talking to zebbie i lost more gyroscopes that way i held up my hand my husband said yes hilda dear

honing to clean the erasers too just a moment son hilda may be the perfect case to find out whether or not what i have tried to convey to youand which really cant be conveyed save in the equations your cousin zebulon used a mathematics you say is unfamiliar to you it is but which you appear to grasp as mechanics would you explain the concept to hilda if she understands it we may hypothesize

television or holovision i just twist knobs go ahead zebbie take a swing at it i dare you ill try zebbie agreed but sharpie dont chatter and keep your comments to the point or ill ask pop to give you a fat lip he wouldnt dast so im going to give him a horsewhip for a wedding presentbesides the weird tales jake you get those too but you need a whip attention sharpie yes zebbie and the same to you
