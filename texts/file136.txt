her in the cascades for three days while zeb and i found and bought a farmhouse outside tacomaanalog that night we moved gay into the barn slapped white paint on the buildings windows and slept in gay with a feeling of being home we own six hectares and live in the farmhouse in front of gays hideaway gay will eventually go underground protected by reinforced concrete the barn will become a machine shop we will build a new house over her bunker meanwhile our old farmhouse is comfortable this united states population under a hundred million accepts immigrants freely zeb considered buying phony papers to let us enter legallybut hilda decided that it was simpler to use gay to smuggle us while we smuggled gay the outcome is the same we will never be a burden to the stateonce we get our machine shop and electronics lab set up zeb and i will invent hundreds of gadgets this country lacks we seem to be near the warmest part of an interglaciation wheat grows where our native world has frozen tundra the greenland icecap has vanished lowlands are under water coastlines much changed climate and custom encourage light clothing the preposterous body modesty taboo does not exist clothing is worn for adornment and for protection never through shame nakedness is symbolic of innocencethese people derive that symbology from the bible used in our native culture to justify the exact opposite the same biblei checked the bible is such a gargantuan collection of conflicting values that anyone can prove anything from it so this is not a world where alien vermin can hide a man who at all times kept arms and legs covered by long sleeves and long trousers would be as conspicuous as one in armor the sects here are mostly christianon a saturday morning one sees families headed for church in their finest sabbathgotomeeting clothes but since nakedness is symbolic of innocence they undress in an anteroom to enter their temple unadorned one need not attend services to see this the climate favors light airy structures that are mostly roof and slender columns the bible affects their penal system again by selective quotation eye for eye tooth for tooth this results in a fluid code with no intent to rehabilitate but to make the punishment fit the crime i saw an example four days after we settled i was driving our steam wagon and encountered a road block a policeman told me that i could take a detour or wait twenty minutes the highway was being used to balance a reckless driver i elected to pull over and wait a man was staked with one leg stretched out at a right angle a police wagon drove down that cleared highway ran over his leg turned and drove back over it an ambulance was waitingbut nothing was done for a timed seventeen minutes then surgeons amputated on the spot the ambulance took him away and the block was removed i went back to my wagon and shook for many minutes then returned home driving cautiously i didnt tell our family but it was reported on radio and the evening paper had picturesso i admitted that i had seen it the paper noted that the criminals insurance had been insufficient to cover the courts award to the victim so the reckless driver had not only lost his left leg as had his victim but also had had most of his worldly goods confiscated there is no speed limit and traffic regulations are merely advisorybut there are extremely few accidents i have never encountered such polite and careful drivers a poisoner is killed by poison an arsonist is burned to death i wont describe what is done to a rapist but poisoning arson and rape are almost unknown my encounter with this brutal system of balancing almost caused me to think that my dear wife had been mistaken in picking this worldwe should move i am no longer certain this place has no prisons almost no crime and it is the safest place to raise children ive ever heard of we are having to relearn history the years of rising waters explain themselves the change came before  by  new shorelines had stabilized that had endless consequencesmass migrations political disorder a return of the black death and much immigration from great britain and the lowlands of europe while the waters rose slavery never established here indentures yesmany a man indentured himself to get his family away from doomed land but the circumstances that could have created king cotton were destroyed by rising waters there are citizens here of african descent but their ancestors were not slaves some have indentured ancestors no doubtbut everyone claims indentured ancestors even if they have to invent them some aspects of history seem to be taboo ive given up trying to find out what happened in  the year they hanged the lawyers when i asked a librarian for a book on that year and decade he wanted to know why i needed access to records in locked vaults i left without giving my name there is free speechbut some subjects are not discussed since they are never defined we try to be careful but there is no category lawyers in the telephone book taxation is low simpleand contains a surprise the federal government is supported by a head tax paid by the states and is mostly for military and foreign affairs this state derives most of its revenue from real estate taxes it is a uniform rate set annually with no property exempted not even churches hospitals or schoolsor roads the best roads are toll roads the surprise lies in this the owner appraises his own property there is a sting in the tail anyone can buy property against the owners wishes at the appraisal the owner placed on it the owner can hang on only by raising his appraisal at once to a figure
