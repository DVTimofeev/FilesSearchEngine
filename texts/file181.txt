tanstaafl all the traffic will bear but we arent ghouls well accept a lien against a clients future earnings with no security and only the going rate of interest then let him take as long as he likes to figure out that it doesnt pay to cheat us but hazel ishtar never solicits the clinic doesnt even have a flack but if you asked her you would go to the top of the list as my friend however she will supply painless suicide just as readily you can have that later today no charge compliments of the house lafe i dont see how your wives put up with you they dont they make me toe the line something they learned from the stone gang i believe well im not trying to suicide im less than two hundred terran years old with a luna background to stretch it this is the first time ive been on a heavy planet since the last time i saw you ill last a while but lazarus i have no wish to be a young girl hazel huh jubal keep out of this say did you ever see anything of that young man again did he resurrect the way some claim he did not to my knowledge although i saw something a while ago that made me wonder hazel im going to take rejuvenationnd hang onto my present appearance red nose and all hazel turned abruptly to face lazarus is this true can this be done maureen answered hazel i work at the clinic at the bedpan level with the expectation of becoming a junior rejuvenation technician in upteen years i see what goes on a client states in writing what apparent age she prefers thats skin deep easy to do easy to maintain but unless it is an unusual contract we turn out a biologically mature young adult call it eighteen standard years page ponce de leon you mean i can still be me but get rid of the morning aches and the arthritic twinges and the fortyleven other things that are the real trouble with living too long exactly uh what about what im sitting on havent used it much lately or wanted to lazarus fielded this youll want to unless you contract for an abnormal endocrine balance but hazel there are many men who prefer to deal with an old established reliable firm ask tamara uh be switched if im not feeling embarrassed an emotion i havent felt in more years than ill admit you can pick any apparent age you say could i be uh late middle age my hair its right color but streaked with gray a sag under my chin instead of this wattle teats a man might grab and enjoy it that old established firmbut not decrepit certainly said lazarus hazel i can take you to the clinic now maureen offered always someone in the business office discuss types of contract decide what you want and when even get your prelim physical today and set date of admission uhes im interested but not till later today ive got friends entered in the preliminary rounds of the society for creative anachronism besides jubal put in they need time to check your credit rating see what they can stick you for by now lafe has given athene some signal to start xraying your purse he has not hilda denied i did hazel we dont solicit business we let the client sell it to herself maureen picks up one percent on this deal not lazarus cant see that it matters jacob added hey waiter over here please we longs pool the boodle and deety tells us what we have what we can spendbut not who fetched it in jacob its the principle making money is a game maureen landed her hazel landed herself hilda hazel stone put in i dont enjoy getting up feeling wobbly jubal are you game for this my minds made up then take a double room with me and we can tell each other lies while they make us feel young again hilda is that kosher lots of double rooms ish knows that you are both special friends of lazarus and while she doesnt spoil lazarus shell do him any reasonable favor hilda assured her i think its the same all around waitercharge it to my account my check said jubal waiter hilda said firmly the waiter looked at her flexed his jaw muscles said very well directorand vanished i think i missed something jubal remarked i think i didnt said hazel yon cashier hath a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous jubal looked around that cashier is our waiter i think i know and bartender and ticket taker unless his mother had quadruplets he has niven dislocators built into his shoes i wish i could remember where i have seen him he is not pleased with hilda or lazarus eh why wait and see there will not be another tab brought to this tablewant to bet no bet lazarus interrupted the upstart knows who i am who hilda is people at this table are guests of the management he had
