time is it in the ship and what is ships routine the others had let me and my new twin chatter now lazarus said if this madhouse has a routine ive never found it  buddy boy you dont have a routine i run this joint on the bell deety its justbongtwentyone and lazarus never went to bed that early in all his evil years buddy boy what are you dodging manners dora yes pappy deety hes dodging the chicanery with which he fooled even himself because he must admit the triple chicanery he wants to rope you in onand it takes gay because im not built for it until today i never heard of t tau and teh i thought tthat you call tauwas all there was aside from paratime in an encapsulation surrounded by irrelevancy such as i am taking us through but back to the corpse caper lib got herself killed about eight hundred post diaspora lazarus slaps herhiminto a tank of lox and places himherit in orbit with a beacon comes back quick as he canand cant find libbys cadaver fourteen centuries later my sister teena then known as minerva sees what should have been obvious that any irrelevant ship such as yours truly is a time machine as well as a starship a great light dawns on lazarus the corpse pickled in lox is missing because he picked it up earlier so he tries again more than a thousand years later and five years earlierand there it is so lazarqs and i and lazlor go to  oldstyleorgregorian old home terra and bury lib from the sky into the ozarks where shehewas bornwhich was pretty silly because we chucked her into those green hills about a century before she washehe was born a paradox but paradoxes dont trouble us we live in paratime lazlor are acute cases of parapsychology we operate under paradoctrines why take your familyfour doctors a double pair o docs dora pappy youre jealous but ill say this for lazarus hes slow but he gets there and has believed all his life that any paradox can be paradoctored happens he had lots of time to think after he chucked lib to a fiery grave because he stayed in that primitive era and got his arse shot off and this caused a long convalescence it occurs to him that if he found the corpse through going back to shortly after he placed it in orbit he might learn something interesting if he went back just before he put libs remains in orbit so when hes well again he does so with his whole first team headed by doctor ishtar the greatest in the business and im outfitted as a hospital with everything from microtomes to cloning capsules so we go there and waitwe dont land along comes lazarus in the clunker that he and lib used to risk their lives in and pappy comes out in a pressure suit and detaches the lox tank and lib is buried in space waiting for judgment day we respect pappys griefjust long enough for him to get out of the way then i take the tank inside me ish gets to work along with many others lots of live cells suitable for cloning brain intact dead but intact okay as all ish wants are the memory configurations in the course of this ishtar learns that the late lamented had the potential to go either waywhich is why the families best telepathic hypnotist is sent for and keeps asking this clone when you wake up what do you want to be man or woman it was much later dora i was already awake lib hon you ask ish you had to decide long before you woke ish and her hormone artists had to work on you while you were still labile matter of fact you never answered at all the telepath kept reporting on your emotional state whenever you imagined yourself male and your state when you imagined yourself female ish says that it made you happy to think of yourself as female thats true ive been ever so much happier as elizabeth long than i was as andy libby thats it folks how ish turned a mixedup male into a happy female fully functional and horny as howard females always are dora we have guests lazarus glowered all married deety is youngest deety did my bluntness shock you no dora im horny enough to be a howard myself and terribly interested in how the great slipstick libby turns out to be my twin and female female without surgerynone of those fakes done with a knife but even ish couldnt have done it had not lib supplied xxy so that ish could balance the clone either xx or xy by careful attention to endocrinal glands or could she must ask ish is geniuscubed smarter than most computers lazarus can now explain his next sleightofhandslightly illegal hey i protested how about the corpse jettisoned into the ozarks dora who was that why that was lib lib is right here ive got my arm around her that computer went tsktsktsk deety doctor deety ijust finished telling you that the lib you are cuddling is a clone after they drained every memory out of that frozen brain what was left was dog food lib got slashed in the spine by the local equivalent of a cave bear ripped out herhisbackbone once ish was through with it laz froze it again we took it back and placed it in orbit where we found it laterto our great surprise how could you be surprised when you put it there yourselves dora announced loudly is there a mathematician in the house stop it dora thank you for recounting my saga i learn a little every time i hear it lib turned toward me and said softly biological time versus durational time twin follow the entropy arrow through the loops of biological time and
