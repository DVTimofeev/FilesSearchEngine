had never really believed that zebadiah would resign but now i was shocked and bewildered and hurt zebadiah what have i done the same sort of nonsense as the other two but harder for me because im married to you but but what ill tell you in private its all right for pop and aunt hilda to hear not with me we can share our joys with others but difficulties between us we settle in private my nose was stuffy and i was blinking back tears but i must know dejah thoris you can list the incidents if you choose to be honest with yourself you have perfect memory and it all took place in the last
