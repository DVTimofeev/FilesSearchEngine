attention class the two prongs of the caltrop painted blue represent our threedimensional space of experience the third prong painted yellow is the ttime we are used to the red fourth prong simulates both tautime and tehtime the unexplored time dimensions necessary to jakes theory sharpie we have condensed six dimensions into four then we either work by analogy into six or we have to use math that apparently nobody but jake and my cousin ed understands unless you can think of some way to project six dimensions into threeyou seem to be smart at such projections i closed my eyes and thought hard zebbie i dont think it can be done maybe escher could have done it it can be done my dearest answered my dearest but it is unsatisfactory even with a display computer with capacity to subtract one or more dimensions at a time a superhypertesseracta to the sixth powerhas too many lines and corners and planes and solids and hypersolids for the eye to grasp cause the computer to subtract dimensions and what you have left is what you already knew i fear it is an innate incapacity of visual conception in the human brain i think pop is right agreed deety i worked hard on that program i dont think the late great dr marvin minsky could have done it better in flat projection holovision i dont know i would like to try if i ever get my hands on a computer with holovideo display and the capacity to add subtract and rotate six coordinates but why six dimensions i asked why not five or even four since you speak of rotating them interchangeably jake said zeb my darling looked fussed it bothered me that a spacetime continuum seemed to require three space dimensions but only one time dimension granted that the universe is what it is nevertheless nature is filled with symmetries even after the destruction of the parity principle scientists kept finding new ones philosophers stay wedded to symmetrybut i dont count philosophers of course not agreed zeb no philosopher allows his opinions to be swayed by factshe would be kicked out of his guild theologians the lot of them i concur hilda my darling after i found a way to experiment it turned out that six dimensions existed possibly morebut i see no way to reach them let me see i said if i understood earlier each dimension can be swapped for any other by ninetydegree rotation yes wouldnt that be the combinations taken four at a time out of a set of six how many is that fifteen zebbie answered goodness fifteen whole universes and we use only one no no my darling that would be ninetydegree rotations of one euclidean universe but our universe or universes has been known to be noneuclidean at least since  or  if you prefer i stipulate that cosmology is an imperfect discipline nevertheless for considerations that i cannot state in nonmathematical terms i was forced to assume a curved space of positive radiusthat is to say a closed space that makes the universes possibly accessible to use either by rotation or by translation this number my husband rapidly wrote three sixes six sixtysix i said wonderingly the number of the beast eh oh the revelation of saint john the divine but i scrawled it sloppily you took it that i wrote this  but what i intended to write was this   six raised to its sixth power and the result in turn raised to its sixth power that number is this   x  or written in full  or more than ten million sextillion universes in our group what can one say to that jacob went on those universes are our nextdoor neighbors one rotation or one translation away but if one includes comb inations of rotation and translationthink of a hyperplane slicing through superhypercontinua not at the point of herenowthe total becomes indenumerable not infinityinfinity has no meaning uncountable not subject to manipulation by mathematics thus far invented accessible to continua craft but no known way to count them pop yes deety maybe aunt hilda hit on something agnostic as you are you nevertheless keep the bible around as history and poetry and myth who said i was agnostic my daughter sorry sir i long ago reached that conclusion because you wont talk about it wrong of me lack of data never justifies a conclusion but this key numberonepointohthreeonefourfourplus times ten to its twentyeighth powerperhaps that is the number of the beast what do you mean deety that revelation isnt history its not good poetry and its not myth there must have been some reason for a large number of learned men to include it while chucking out several dozen gospels why not make a first hypothesis with occams razor and read it as what it purports to be prophecy hmm the shelves under the stairs next to shakespeare the king james version never mind the other three deety was back in a moment with a wellworn black bookwhich surprised me i read the bible for my own reasons but it never occurred to me that jacob would we always marry strangers here said deety chapter thirteen verse eighteen here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six that cant be read as exponents deety but this is a translation pop wasnt the original in greek i dont remember when exponents were invented but the greek mathematicians of that time certainly understood powers suppose the original read zeta zeta zetaand those scholars who werent mathematicians mistranslated it as six hundred and sixtysix uhoondrift daughter who taught me that the world is not only stranger than we imagine but stranger than we can imagine who has already taken me into two universes that are not this one
