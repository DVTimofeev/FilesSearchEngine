times must i repeat that i am not crowding you out of your home we are cohousewivesmy only seniority lies in being twenty years older to my regret hilda my dear one what would you say to a workbench in the garage with a drop cloth on it and flood lights over it i say swell i dont think a dining table is the place for a dissection either but i couldnt think of anywhere else with help from jake i got that damned carcass draped across my shoulders in firemans carry deety started up the path with me carrying my belt and sword and my briefs in one arm so that she could hold my free handdespite my warning that she might be splashed with alien blood no zebadiah i got overtaken by childishness i wont let it happen again i must conquer all squeamishnessill be changing diapers soon she was silent a moment that is the first time ive seen death in a person i mean an alien humanoid person i should say but i thought he was a man i once saw a puppy run overi threw up even though it was not my puppy and i didnt go close she added an adult should face up to death should she not face up to it yes i agreed but not grow calloused deety ive seen too many men die ive never grown inured to it one must accept death learn not to fear it then never worry about it make today count as a friend whose days are numbered told me live in that spirit and when death comes it will come as a welcome friend you say much what my mother told me before she died your mother must have been an extraordinary woman deety in the two weeks ive known you ive heard so much about her from all three of you that i feel as if i knew her a friend i hadnt seen lately she sounds like a wise woman i think she was zebadiah certainly she was good sometimes when i have a hard choice i ask myself what would mama doand

and hilda had lingered at the pool while jake washed his hands and rinsed from his body smears of alien ichor being less burdened they climbed the path faster than we and came up behind us just as deety answered zebadiah i never graduated from high school thats right agreed her father deety matriculated by taking college boards at fourteen no problem since she stayed home and didnt have to live in a dorm got her bs in three years and that was a happy thing as jane lived to see deety move the tassel from one side of her mortar board to the other jane in a wheelchair and happy as a childher doctor said it couldnt hurt hereaning she was dying anyhow he added had her mother been granted only three more years she could have seen deetys doctorate conferred two years ago pop sometimes you
