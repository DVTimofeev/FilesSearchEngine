should be in a sealed envelope to establish my reputation as a for tuneteller zebbie there are nine soidisant fictional universes listed any close approach we make by rotation should be near one of them i said you included pellucidar pellucidar got only two votes i stick to my theory that the insideout world is a composite of underground fantasies but our vote identified that third universethe blinding lights the one that worried you about radiation the hell you say i think it did four votes for doctor isaac asimovs nightfall i expected his foundation stories to make it but they got only three votes too bad because his library planet might be able to tell us what those vermin are where they come fromand how to beat them my fault aunt hillbilly pop told me i should read the foundation
