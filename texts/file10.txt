to protect them while pretending to be fragile ourselves to build up their fragile egos but ive never been good at iti like to play with matches aunt hilda you are very good at it in your own way im certain mama knows what youve done for pop and blesses it and is happy for pop for all of usall five of us dont make me cry deety lets break out the orange juice our men will wake any time first secret of living with a man feed him as soon as he wakes so i know yes of course you know ever since we lost jane does zebbie know how lucky he is he says so im going to try hard not to disillusion him v a wedding ring is not a ring in my nose jake i woke in drowsy euphoria became aware that i was in bed in our cabin that my daughter calls snug harborthen woke completely and looked at the other pillowthe dent in it not a dream euphoric for the best of reasons hilda was not in sight i closed my eyes and simulated sleep as i had something to do jane i said in my mind i hear you dearest one it has my blessing now we are all happy together we couldnt expect deety to become a sour old maid just to take care of her crotchety old father this young man hes okay to the nth power i felt it at once and hilda is certain of it he is dont worry jacob our deety can never be sour and you will never be old this is exactly as hilda and i planned it more than five of your years ago predestined she told you so last night okay darling get up and brush your teeth and take a quick shower dont dawdle breakfast is waiting call me when you need me kiss so i got up feeling like a boy on christmas morning everything was jake with jake jane had put her stamp of approval on it let me tell you you nonexistent reader sitting there with a tolerant sneer dont be smug jane is more real than you are the spirit of a good woman cannot be coded by nucleic acids arranged in a double helix and only an overeducated fool could think so i could prove that mathematically save that mathematics can never prove anything no mathematics has any content all any mathematics can do issometimesturn out to be useful in describing some aspects of our socalled physical universe that is a bonus most forms of

handed down by any pope speaking ex cathedra if this be blasphemy make the most of it i wont budge jane is was and ever shall be worlds without end i had the priceless privilege of living with her for eighteen years and i can never lose her hilda was not in the bath but my toothbrush was damp i smiled at this logical as any germs i was harboring hilda now hadand hilda for all her playfulness is
