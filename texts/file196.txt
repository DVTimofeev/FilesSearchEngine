a terrycloth sarong deety had bought for methe day promised to be a scorcher even that hip wrap was a concession to propriety ie i did not know my new soninlaw well enough to subject him abruptly to our casual ways it might offend deety i was last up and saw that all had made much the same decision deety was wearing what amounted to a bikini minimum indecently decent and my bride was dressed in a tieon job belonging to deety the tieties had unusually large bows hilda is tiny my daughter is not zeb was the only one fully dressed an old pair of working shorts a wornout denim shirt deety had confiscated and his evening shoes he was dressed for the street in any western town save for one thing im built like a pear zeb is built like the gray lensman my shorts fitted him well enougha bit loosebut his shoulders were splitting the shirts seams he looked uncomfortable i took care of amenitiesa goodmorning to all a kiss for my bride one for my daughter a handshake for my soninlawgood hands calloused then i said zeb take that shirt off its hot and getting hotter relax this is your home thanks pop zeb peeled off my shirt hilda stood up on her chair making her about as tall as zeb im a militant womensrights gal she announced and a wedding ring is not a ring in my nosea ring that you have not yet given me you old goat when have i had time youll get one dearfirst chance excuses excuses dont interrupt when im orating sauce for the gander is no excuse for goosing the goose if you male chauvinist pigsi mean goatscan dress comfortably deety and i have the same privilege whereupon my lovely little bride untied that bikini top and threw it aside like a stripper whats for breakfast asked pooh i misquoted i was not answered deety made me proud of her for the nth time for years she had consulted me at least with her eyes on policy decisions now she looked not at me but at her husband zeb was doing old stone face refusing assent or dissent deety stared at him gave a tiny shrug reached behind her and untied or unsnapped something and discarded her own top i said whats for breakfast i repeated greedy gut my daughter answered you men have had baths while aunt hilda and i havent had a chance to get clean for fear of waking you slugabeds is that what it is i thought a skunk had wandered past whats for breakfast aunt hilda in only hours pop has lost all the training ive given him for five years pop its laid out and ready to go how about cooking while hilda and i grab a tub zeb stood up ill cook deety ive been getting my own breakfast for years hold it buster my bride interrupted sit down zebbie deety never encourage a man to cook breakfast it causes him to wonder if women are necessary if you always get his breakfast and dont raise controversial issues until after his second cup of coffee you can get away with murder the rest of the time they dont notice other odors when they smell bacon im going to have to coach you my daughter reversed the field fast she turned to her husband and said meekly what does my captain wish for breakfast my princess whatever your lovely hands offer me what we were offered as fast as deety could pour batter and hilda could serve was a gourmet specialty that would enrage a cordon bleu but which for my taste is ambrosia a oneeyed texas stacka tall stack of thin tender buttermilk pancakes to janes recipe supporting one large egg up and easy surrounded by hot sausage and the edifice drowned in melting butter and hot maple syrup with a big glass of orange juice and a big mug of coffee on the side zeb ate two stacks i concluded that my daughter would have a happy marriage vi are men and women one race hilda deety and i washed dishes then soaked in her tub and talked about husbands we giggled and talked with the frankness of women who trust each other and are sure that no men can overhear do men talk that openly in parallel circumstances from all i have been able to learn in aftermidnight horizontal conversations all passion spent men do not or not men i would take to bed whereas a perfect lady which jane was deety is and i can simulate will talk with another perfect lady she trusts in a way that would cause her father husband or son to faint i had better leave out our conversation this memoir might fall into the hands of one of the weaker sex and i would not want his death on my conscience are men and women one race i know what biologists saybut history is loaded with scientists jumping to conclusions from superficial evidence it seems to me far more likely that they are symbiotes i am not speaking from ignorance i was one trimester short of a bs in biology and a straighta student when a biology experiment blew up in my face and caused me to leave school abruptly not that i need that degree ive papered my private bath with honorary degrees mostly doctorates i hear that there are things no whore will do for money but i have yet to find anything that a university chancellor faced with a deficit will boggle at the secret is never to set up a permanent fund but to dole it out when need is sharpest once every academic year done that way you not only own a campus but also the town cops learn that its a waste of time to hassle you a univerity alway tand taunchly by it olvent aociate that
