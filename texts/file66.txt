that was a bad mistake a sea captain is still captain when his ship is anchored whoever becomes captain should profit by my mistake and not relinquish any authority merely because gay is grounded she can relax the rules according to the situation but the captain must decide the situation can be more dangerous on the ground than in air or in space as it was today when the russians showed up simply grounding must not be schools out now we can play im sorry zebbie hilda i was more at fault than you i wanted to be free of responsibility i let myself be talked into it then my brain went on vacation take that practice hike i dont recall who suggested it i did said my father maybe you did jake but we all climbed on the bandwagon we were about to run off like a bunch of scouts with no scoutmaster if we had started as quickly as we had expected to where would we be now in a russian jail or dead oh im not giving myself high marks one reason ive resigned is that i havent handled it well planning to leave gay deceiver and everything we own unguarded while we made walkaboutgood god if i had felt the weight of command i would never have considered it zebadiah made a sour face then looked at my father jake youre eldest why dont you take the gavel while we pick a new co i so move second question white ballot what gavel ill bet there isnt a gavel on this planetin a moment father quit stalling we all voted using a page from zebadiahs notebook torn in four they were folded and handed to me and i was required to declare the vote so i did zeb zebadiah zebbje sharpie zebadiah reached back got the ballots from me handed back the one that meant aunt hilda took the other three and tore them into small pieces apparently you did not understand me ive stood my watch someone else must take itor well park on this bank until we die of old age sharpie seems to have an overwhelming leadis she elected or do we ballot again we balloted again sharpie jacob jacob hilda a tie father said shall we invite gay to vote shut up and deal the cards sharpie deety deety hilda hey i protested who switched i certainly didnt vote for me sharpie hilda zebbie hilda one spoiled ballot said my husband a noncandidate will you confirm that mr chairman yes pop agreed my dear captain hilda you are elected without a dissenting vote aunt hilda looked as if she might cry again youre a bunch of stinkers so we are agreed my husband but we are your stinkers captain hilda that got him a wan smile guess maybe well ill try well all try said pop and well all help said my husband sure we will i said and meant it pop said if you will excuse me ive been anxious to find a handy bush since before this started he started to get out just a moment eh yes my dear captain no one is to seek out a bush without an armed guard not moreand not lessthan two people are to leave the cars vicinity at one time jacob if your need is urgent you must ask zebbie to hurryi want the guard to carry both rifle and pistol i think it worked out that pop got the use of a bush lastand must have been about to burst his bladder later i overheard pop say son youve read aesops fables certainly does anything remind you of king log and king stork xxii from each according to his ability to each according to his needs hilda i could tell from the first ballot that zebbie was determined to make me take a turn as captain once i realized that i decided to be captainlet them get sick of me and anxious to have zebbie back then suddenly i was captainand its different i did not ever again think of trying to make them sick of me i just started to worry and try first my husband wanted to find a bush for the obvious reasonand i suddenly realized that a banth might get him not a barsoomian banth but whatever this planet held in dangerous carnivores so i ordered armed guards with rules about not getting separated it was a nuisance but i was firm and knew at last what a crushing load there had been on zebbie but one thing i could improve arrange for us to sleep inside the car the space back of the bulkhead behind the rear seats was not organized we had about six hours till sundown having gained on the sun in going west so i had everything in that space pulled out space enough for zebbie and deety on his sleeping bag opened out blankets over them jacob and i the piloting chairs we moved forward all the set screws would allow laid them back almost fht and padded the cracks with pillows and to support our legs the cushions from the rear seats were placed on boxes we would otherwise discard once i had the car organized it wasnt the best bed but low gravity and my cuddlesome husband made it a most attractive one baths in the stream and cold same rules as for bushes armed guards soap thoroughly on the bank get in and rinse fast bounce out and towel till you glowed primitive luxurious this did not go smoothly take the handy bush problem i did not have to be told that a latrine should be downstream or that our shovel should be carried every time without failrules for a clean camp are as old as the old testment but my first order called for no more than two and no less than two to leave the car at
