interesting to watch when one participant is safetybelted and the other half is floating free hilda held pops cheeks he had her head in his hands and aunt hilda drifted like a flag in a breeze she was dressed but barefooted i was intrigued when she curled her toes hard was pop that goodmy cubical father so i had thought until recently did jane teach him or shut up deety youre a voyeuse with a nasty curiosity they broke and hilda floated between the pilot seats a hand on each and looked at the board my husband saidto her not to medont i get a kiss it was my razor aunt hilda hesitated pop said kiss him beloved or hell sulk so she did it occurs to me that aunt hilda may have taught zebadiah and that mama jane and aunt hilda may have been trained by the same coach before pop came alongif so who was my unknown benefactor not a whole lot zebadiah was saying mostly tapes from bbc five minutes of news from windsor citywhich may be the city we bingoedas exciting as local news from any town youve never been in chatter in russian the smart girl saved that for you ill listen to it but i must learn something i was tempery a while ago but a nap fixed me up and now i am filled with sweetness and light i must have a report from each of you we all have had cumulative fatigue it is now bedtime at termite terrace but about lunchtime in windsor city if that is its name we can go back to our stream or we can tackle the british i am not taking a vote i shall decide and i have a way to take care of anyone who is tired but i insist on honest data deety captain auntie sleep is never my problem zebbie i was a zombie until you recharged me now im rarin to go she mussed his hair zebbie quit teasing captain on an earlier occasion i told you the facts my alert time exceeds twentyfour hours fortyeight if i must if that kiss did not stimulate you as much as it did me lets try it again and find out what went wrong aunt hilda turned away abruptly jacob dear how do you feel with the time difference this may be equivalent to staying up all night possibly under great tension hilda my love were we to return to our streamside i would not sleep knowing that this contact was coming a night without sleep does not strain me pops not exaggerating captain auntie i get my nightowl capacity from pop very well but i have a method of taking care of anyone who may have exaggerated i can leave one person aboard as guard captain this wagon does not need a guard chief pilot i was offering sleepunder pretext of guarding car locked and sleep where ijust nappedoutsiders would not know anyone speak up i wouldnt have missed it for a persian kitten did hilda expect anyone to stay behind i dont think so very well no firearms gentlemen please hide your pistols and belts with the guns aft zebbie is there a way to lock that door in addition to dogging it sure tell gay may i ask why no one can break into the cabin without damaging the old girl so much that she wont lift conceded zebbie but i will be bringing visitors into this space if anyone is brash enough to ask to be shown beyond the bulkhead door i shall tell him that is my private compartment aunt hilda grinned wickedly
