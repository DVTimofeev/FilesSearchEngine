many things on my mind i know dear sharpie does not mean to scold but i had to get your attention that baseball bat almost for an ersatz canteen a hotwater bottle again she startled me in the danger we were in when we left you worried about cold feet in bed and packed a hotwater bottle two answered deety aunt hilda fetched one so did i deety you dont have cold feet and neither do i sharpie said deety is he actually that nave im afraid he is aunt hilda but hes sweet and brave added hilda but retarded in spots they do overlap in zebbies case hes unique what i demanded are you talking about aunt hilda means that when you refitted gay you neglected to install a bidet oh that was the wittiest i could manage its not a subject i give much thought to no reason you should zebbie although men use them too zebadiah does pop too bidets i mean not hotwater bottles i meant hotwater bottles dear as medical officer i may find it necessary to administer an enema to the captain oh no i objected youre not equipped but she is zebadiah we fetched both sorts of nozzles but you didnt fetch four husky orderlies to hold me down lets move on sharpie what was the advice you would have given if i had been bright enough to consult you some is not advice but a statement of fact im not going for a hike on a hot day swaddled in a pinnedup jump suit eight sizes too big while you all play cowboysandindians im going to curl up in my seat and read the oxford book of english verse thank you for fetching it jacob hilda beloved i will worry no need to worry about me jacob i can always tell gay to lock her doors but were i to go with you i would be a handicap you three are trained to fight im not sharpie turned toward me captain since im not going thats all i have to say what was there for me to say thank you hilda deety do you have things on your mind yes sir i go along with field boots and jump suits and so forth even though theyll be beastly hot but i wish you would change your mind about your sword and pops saber maybe they arent much compared with rifles but theyre good for my morale hilda interjected had i decided to go captain i would have said the same possibly it is an emotional effect from what happened uhwas it only yesterdaybut perhaps it is subconscious logic just yesterday bare blades defeated a mana thing an alienarmed with a firearm and ready to use it jake spoke up captain i didnt want to take off my saber well wear them any excuse is a good excuse to wear a sword are we through weve lost an hour and the sun is dropping deety one more thing zebadiahand i expect to be outvoted i say to cancel the hike so princess youve said too much or not enough if we do this we spend the night heresitting up if we chase the sun instead there were lights on the night side that looked like cities there was blue on the day side that looked like a sea i think i saw canals but whether we find something or not at worst well catch up with sunrise and be able to sleep outdoors in daylight just as we did today deety gay can overtake the sun once you want to use all her remaining juice just to sleep outdoors zebadiah i wasnt planning on using any power huh it sounded like it oh no do transitions of three minima or more bearing west aim us out of the atmosphere we fall back in while looking for places of interest as we reenter we glide but where depends on what you want to look at when you have stretched the glide to the limit unless you decide to ground you do another transition there is great flexibility zebadiah you can reach sunrise line in the next few minutes or you could elect to stay on the day side for weeks never land never use any juice and inspect the entire planet from pole to pole maybe gay can stay up for weeksbut not me im good for several more hours with that limitation it sounds good how about it hilda jake you mean that female suffrage is permanent i vote yes jake said you have a majority no need for a male vote jacob his wife said reproachfully joking my dear its unanimous i said somebody just cancelled the election look there we all looked deety said what is it a pterodactyl no an ornithopter a big one xix something is gained in translation hilda jacob tightened his arm around me zeb he said softly i dont believe it he was staring we all were at this mechaniwockle pteranodon coming at us over the hills in the west neither do i zebbie answered wrong wing loading impossible articulation theres a second one a third all hands grab your clothes man the ship prepare to lift move jake unbuckle your saber and into your jump suit fast capn zebbie was unhooking his sword belt and grabbing his coveralls as he yelped i was inside first as i didnt stop to dressgrabbed deetys baby shoes with one hand my dress and panties with the other i wiggled into panties slid the dress over my head slipped on deetys keds i anticipated the order to fasten seat beltsstopped suddenly and eased my belt i had not stopped to take off the doodads that proclaimed me a barsoomian princess now it seemed that every item of frippery was about to imprint me for life deety was cursing softly over the same problem deetys jump suit was harder to
