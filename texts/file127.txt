matter of selection of coordinates at the end of the reign of queen victoria you will have published it five years earlier is that clear he answered very solemnly quite clear all i need do is to ask her majesty how much longer she is going to reign and subtract five years that should do it do you like to play with sorites for the first time he smiled oh very much shall we make up some then trade and solve them well not too lengthy i really must get back to my young charges we cant stay long either anyone else want to play no one else elected to play i stretched out on the grass with a handkerchief over my face jake and sharpie went for a walk shall we hold the statements down to groups of six dodgson suggested all right but the conclusion must be true not nonsense agreed deety had taught me this game shes good at it i decided to be a silent witness they kept quiet while i snored convincingly deety was a lady for a while then sprawled on her belly and chewed her pencil i watched with one eye from under my handkerchief first she covered several pages with scratch work in developing statements incomplete in themselves but intended to arrive at only one possible conclusion

wife asked just finished mrs carter you remind me of my little friend alice liddell i know she said thats how i recognized her shall we trade dodgson tore a sheet from his pad this is to be solved in the first person its conclusion applies to you all right ill try it deety read aloud  every idea of mine that cannot be expressed as a syllogism is really ridiculous  none of my ideas about bathbuns are worth writing down  no idea of mine that fails to come true can be expressed as a syllogism  i never have any really ridiculous idea that i do not at once refer to my solicitor  my dreams are all about bathbuns  i never refer any idea of mine to my solicitor unless it is worth writing down deety chortled how sweet of you it is true all my dreams do come true you solved it so quickly but its

nothing should be kept in a drawing room unless it is free from damp  timetraveling machines are always kept near the sea  nothing that is what you expect it to be can be absolutely ugly  whatever is kept near the sea gets encrusted with salt he blinked at the list the conclusion is true he asked yes for the first time he stared openly at gay deceiver that theni infer is a timetraveling machine yes although it does other things as well it is not what i expected it to belthough i am not sure what i expected a timetraveling machine to be i pulled his handkerchief off my face do you want to take a ride mr dodgson the young don looked wistful i am sorely tempted captain but i am responsible for three little girls so i must thank you for your hospitality and bid you goodbye will you offer my apologies to professor and mrs burroughs and explain that duty calls me xxxv its a disturbing idea jake deety how does it feel to say goodbye without getting kissed zebadiah i didnt make it possible lewis carroll was terrified by females over the age of puberty thats why i stayed close deety hon if i had gone with jake and hilda he would have left at once i cant figure out how he got
