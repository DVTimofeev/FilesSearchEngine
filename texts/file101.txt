mention of food changed my mind hillbilly whats the rush deety im carrying out my own orders when i brush my teeth after breakfast the toothbrush goes into my purse as for the rush our husbands will wake soon i have found that it is more practical to present a man with a fait accompli than a discussion i hear you three times doll baby when they get up theyll want to eat when our roadable shows up theyll be sitting over second cups of coffee then theyll say well do it when we come back mustnt keep the brigadier waiting okay ill grab our gear and well sneak it out before they wake ill carry the heavy ones we are not permitted to carry anything deety but the place is swarming with maids you sound much married five years practice on pop but hillbilly even pop is easy to handle if you think ahead im learning deety what shall we do about the maids huh in the days when servants were common it was polite for house guests to tip servants who served them personally but how deety i have two twentyfivenewdollar bills in the lining of my purse waste paper pop and zebadiah have gold i know exactly because it was mass enough that i had to figure it into the loading mass and moment arm heres a giggle these misers we married had each squirreled away the same weight of gold to four significant figures so maids are no problem if you know how much to tipi dont well be buying local money today to pay for a number of things leftenant beanor brianis a delightful fuzzy puppy and a volunteer in order to have served beyond the sky he managed to call me deety and zebadiah zeb when invited but he could not bring himself to shift from captain burroughs to hildacaptain hilda was as far as he would go and pop was professor he was pleased that we liked his roadable you wouldnt believe it a large wooden flatbed wagon with an upright steam engine in back a trailer with cordwood a sailingships wheel in front of the engine this controlled the front wheels by ropes that ran underneath midway was a luggage pen then in front were four benches for twelve to sixteen people with a crew of five engine driver fireman conductor and two steersmen the conductor sat on a high perch braced to the pen and told the others what to do and occasionally rang a bell or blew a whistle the bell told other traffic to get out of the way the whistle warned that the vehicle was about to start or stop there was much traffic but few roadablesmost common were pedalled tricycles for passengers and freight large versions had as many as a dozen men pedalling at once i daresay you know said brian that we have not been able to raise horses we havent given upwe will develop a breed that will prosper here but once we have horses this will i venture to predict become a proper colonyand not just a place to send reformable evildoers and to obtain raw pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals oh definitely the thing that makes the colony selfsupporting i daresay the descendants of these convicts will be wealthy i will show you the fields all in the weeda cant word
