my father football basketball and trackthey would have demanded more had they been able to figure a way to do it i had thought you were going to mention fencing no thats another story these did not quite close the gap so i also waited tables for mealsfood so bad the cockroaches ate out but that closed the gap and i added to it by tutoring in mathematics that gave me my start toward piling up money to qualify i asked did tutoring math pay enough to matter i tutored math before mama died the hourly rate was low not that sort of tutoring princess i taught prosperous young optimists not to draw to inside straights and that stud poker is not a game of chance but that craps is controlled by mathematical laws that cannot be flouted with impunity to quote grandfather zachariah a man who bets on greed and dishonesty wont be wrong too often there is an amazingly high percentage of greedy people and it is even easier to win from a dishonest gambler than it is from an honest one and neither is likely to know the odds at craps especially side bets or all of the odds in poker in particular how odds change according to the number of players where one is seated in relation to the dealer and how to calculate changes as cards are exposed in stud that was also how i quit drinking my darling except for special celebrations in every friendly game some players contribute some take a profit a player determined to take a profit must be neither drunk nor tired pop the shadows are growing longi dont think anybody wants to know how i got a worthless doctorate i do i put in me too echoed aunt hilda son youre outvoted okay two years active duty after i graduated sky jockeys are even more optimistic than students and have more moneymeanwhile i learned more math and engineering was sent inactive just in time to be called up again for the spasm war didnt get hurt i was safer than civilians but that kept me on another year even though fighting was mostly over before i reported in that made me a veteran with benefits i went to manhattan and signed up for school again doctoral candidate school of education not serious at first simply intending to use my veterans benefits while enjoying the benefits of being a studentand devote most of my time to piling up cash to qualify for the trust i knew that the stupidest students the silliest professors and the worst bull courses are concentrated in schools of education by signing for largeclass evening lectures and the unpopular eight am classes i figured i could spend most of my time finding out how the stock market ticked i did by working there before i risked a dime eventually i had to pick a research problem or give up the advantages of being a student i was sick of a school in which the pie was all meringue and no filling but i stuck as i knew how to cope with courses in which the answers are matters of opinion and the opinion that counts is that of the professor and how to cope with those largeclass evening lectures buy the lecture notes read everything that professor ever published dont cut too often and when you do show up get there early sit front row center be certain the prof catches your eye every time he looks your wayby never taking your eyes off him ask one question you know he can answer because youve picked it out of his published papersand state your name in asking a question luckily zebadiah carter is a name easy to remember family i got straight as in both required courses and seminars because i did not study education i studied professors of education but i still had to make that original contribution to human knowledge without which a candidate may not be awarded a doctors degree in most socalled disciplines and the few that dont require it are a tough row to hoe i studied my faculty committee before letting myself be tied down to a research problem not only reading everything each had published but also buying their publications or paying the library to make copies of outofprint papers my husband took me by my shoulders dejah thoris here follows the title of my dissertation you can have your divorce on your own terms zebadiah dont talk that way then brace yourself an adhoc inquiry concerning the optimization of the infrastructure of primary educational institutions at the interface between administration and instruction with special attention to group dynamics desiderata zebbie what does that mean it means nothing hilda zeb quit kidding our ladies such a title would never be accepted jake it seems certain that you have never taken a course in a school of education well no teaching credentials are not required at university level but but me no huts pop i have a copy of my dissertation you can check its authenticity while that paper totally lacks meaning it is a literary gem in the sense in which a successful forging of an old master is itself a work of art it is loaded with buzz words the average length of sentences is eightyone words the average word length discounting of a the and other syntactical particles is elevenplus letters in slightly under four syllables the bibliography is longer than the dissertation and cites three papers of each member of my committee and four of the chairman and those citations are quoted in partwhile avoiding any mention of matters on which i knew that members of the committee held divergent but equally stupid opinions but the best touch was to get permission to do field work in europe and have it count toward time on campus half the citations were in foreign languages ranging from finnish
