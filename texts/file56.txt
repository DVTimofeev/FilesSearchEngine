in your hide youll get well but if something loose catches our captain in the eye the culprit will be broken on the wheel i cluckedclucked at her answer but big ones do get in the way meanwhile our men were having problems that space under the instrument board could not be seen by a fullsized male the best position to reach it was impossible for jacob ridiculously impossible for zebbie zebbies profanity was louder than deetys but not as colorful my own darling was keeping quiet which meant that he was really in trouble i said gentlemen zebbie grunted shut up sharpie weve got problems deety how did you get these toadstickers into this compartment i didnt aunt hilda did sharpie can i apologize later those martians are circling us now so they were at least a dozen flapping monstrosities one appeared about to ground captain ill do itbut there is a faster way how unhook your scabbards put on your sword belts saber and sword in scabbards fit easily if you point one right the other left they will rattle unless you stuff clothing around them they can bloody well rattle in seconds our gallants had blades and scabbards stowed as capn zebbie resumed sword belt and started on his seat

dont do it copilot i dont plan to now drop it the grounded flappy bird was about two hundred meters and a few degrees left of dead ahead two menthey looked like menhad disembarked and headed toward us they were dressed alikeuniforms they seemed vaguely familiarbut all uniforms seem vaguely familiar do they not they were less than a hundred meters from us capn zebbie did something at his instrument board and suddenly their voices were inside blastingly loud he adjusted the setting and we could hear clearly zebbie said thats russian isnt it jake captain i think so a slavic language in any case jacob added do you understand it me jake i said that i can swear in russian i didnt say i could speak it i can say thank you and please and da and nyetmaybe six more how about you i can puzzle out a paper about mathematics with the aid of a dictionary but speak it understand it no i tried to remember whether or not i had ever told zebbie that i know russian my husband and deety i had not told

understood russian at that point i realized that i had been thinking in russian its a wonderful language for paranoid thoughts when zebbie switched on the outside mikes the older was telling the
