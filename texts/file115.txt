say said my daughter deety zeb said forcefully leave well enough alone zebadiah this is to ou quite as muchor moreas it is to pop complaints of another sort my soninlaw looked startled oh sorry you have the floor xxxi the first ghosts ever to search for an obstetrician hilda if zebbie and jacob have a fault in common it is overprotectiveness having always been the runt i am habitually willing to accept protection but deety  rebels when zebbie asked jacob whether or not they were justified in exposing us to unknown dangers deety stuck her oar inand zebbie tried to hush her zebbie should have known better but he is barely getting acquainted with her whereas ive known her since her diaper days once when deety was oh possibly four i started to tie her shoes she pulled away deety do she announced indignantlyand deety did on one shoe a loose half bow that came apart almost at once on the other a gordian knot that required the alexandrian solution its been deety do ever since backed by genius and indomitable will deety told him zebadiah concerning completing this schedule is there some reason to exclude hilda and me from the decision damn it deety this is one time when husbands have to decide damn it zebadiah this is one time when wives must be consulted zebbie was shocked but deety had simply matched his manner and rhetoric zebbie is no fool he backed down im sorry hon he said soberly go ahead yessir im sorry i answered the way i did but i do have something to sayand hilda too i know i speak for both of us when i say that we appreciate that you and pop would die for us and that you feel this more intensely now that we are pregnant but we have not been pregnant long enough to be handicapped our bellies do not bulge they will bulge and that gives us a deadline but for that very reason we will either sample those rotation universes today or we will never sample them why do you say never deety that deadline weve sampled five and scary as some have been i wouldnt have missed it we can look at the other ten in the next few hours but if we start searching teh axis there is no way to guess how long it will take thousands of universes along teh axis and it seems likely that each holds an analog of earth we may check hundreds before we find what we are looking for lets say we find it and hilda and i have babies with skilled medical attention then what zebadiah are you going to be more willing to take women with babies into strange universes than you are without babies uh thats not the way to put it deety how would you put it sir are you thinking that you and pop might check those ten while hilda and i stay home with the kids well yes i suppose i am something of the sort zebadiah i married you for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health i did not marry to walk the widows walk where you go i gotill death do us part deety speaks for me i said and shut up deety had it figured if jacob and zebbie didnt finish those rotations today they would have that far horizons look for the rest of their livesand they wouldnt want us along not with kids sharpie wasnt going to hold still for that no sir deety are you through not quite sir all humans are created unequal you are bigger and stronger than pop i am bigger and stronger than hilda i have the least years of experience pop has the most pop is a supergenius but he concentrates so hard that he forgets to eatunless he has a nursemaid to watch himas mama did as i did as hilda now does you sir are the most allaround competent man ive ever met whether driving a duo or dancing or telling outrageous tales three of us have eight or nine earned degrees but aunt hilda with none is a walking encyclopedia from insatiable curiosity and extraordinary memory we two are baby factories and you two are notbut two men can impregnate fifty womenor five hundred there is no end to the ways that we four are unequal but in one supremely important way all of us are equals we are pioneers men alone are not pioneers they cant be pioneer mothers share the dangers of pioneer fathers and go on having babies babies were born in the mayflower lots were born in covered wagonsand lots died too women didnt stay home they went along zebadiah i do not ask to be taken to those next ten universes it sounds like it you didnt listen sir i would like to finish sampling those fifteen its my preference but not my demand what i do demand i have stated where you go i go today and to the end of our lives unless you tell me to get out that you dont want me anymore i have spoken you certainly have dear hilda fish or cut bait sharpiewhat do you want i didnt care any new universe was bound to be strange but deety had laid down the party line i didnt want to fuzz it upso i answered instantly deety speaks for me in every word jake back to my original question are we justified in exposing our wives to conditions we cant even imagine zeb you are the one who convinced me that it would be prudent to sample the universes accessible through rotation before searching by translation true but that was before we sampled five of them i dont see that the situation has changed an imaginable danger is not necessarily better than an unimaginable one it may be worse our
