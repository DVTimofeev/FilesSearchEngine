know that the next group is one less it wont take ten minutes longer to do it my way and ill be less likely to make mistakes but tackling all fifteen at a slug scares me captain jacob not now hilda i must settle this with captain i am required to advise you eh all right all right make it snappy you knowwe all knowthat zebbies premonitions must not be ignored i advise you officially gay deceiver record this itellyouthreetimes hilda i hear you three times captain jacob i your secondincommand advise you officially to revise the schedule of rotations in the fashion recommended by the copilot end of itellyouthreetimes have you ever found yourself boxed in damn it i intended to let zeb do it his way i am not unreasonable i cant say that i believe in zebs premonitions i suspect that he is simply a man with extremely fast reflexes but both our wives believe in them and zeb does himself i found myself faced with mutiny unless i did exactly what i had intended to do anyway how does one describe  ironical a situation shortly i found myself saying copilot by revised schedule set second rotation of first group we were in sagan orbit around mars of universezero ie the one we had grown up in galactic coordinates x y z  t earthzero marszero sunzero universezero i tend to think of this as the real universe even though i am aware that there is no evidence or mathematical theory for preferring one frame of reference over anotherto do so is egocentric provincialism at its worst but i offer this in mitigation for us it was simplest and thereby helped us to avoid getting lost set copilot zeb reported i went forward checked the setting rotation around y with z and t dropping out null then returned to my seat we can spare a minute to look at mars deety tilt the nose down to let us look do you know how like this captain right i agreed keep it up deety raised the crafts nose and swung right catching me with belts not yet fastened i said forcefully deety what the hell are you doing while i floundered and grabbed sir you ordered right and up deety answered i did no such thing but jacobcaptainyou did tell her that i heard you hilda you keep out of this hilda answered stiffly captain i respectfully request that you either relieve me of the conn or that you give orders to my pilots through me damn it you dont have the conn i do then the captain neglected to relieve me uh take the conn carry out the planned schedule aye aye sir chief pilot orient the car for best view of mars aye aye maam i was fuming not looking hardly listening i had said to deety all right keep on with itor had i gay could play it back and could also check on hildas incredible allegation if i were wrong i felt certain i was not i would face up to it like a man and zeb broke in on my thoughts captain do you care what attitude this craft is in at rotation no only for transitions hmm then it follows as the night from day thou canst not then predict the attitude well be in whenever we arrive in a new universe only with respect to our arbitrary zero reference frame why should it matter it wont as long as we arrive with plenty of room ive been noodling how to be sure of that i dont see an answer but i dont want to try translations or rotations parked on the ground i hope the captain wont order any copilot i have no plans to astrogator havent we had enough sightseeing very well captain my wife acknowledged deety secure those binoculars zebbie immediately after each rotation set next rotation and report set deety after each rotation use voice program to put us through one pigeontumble with all lights out i will watch to port deety forward zebbie starboard questions i said astrogator you did not assign me a sector i have no authority to assign duties to the captain does the captain wish to select a sector and assume responsibility for it she waited i said hastily no perhaps it will be best for me to watch in all directions general supervision very well captain copilotexecute again we rotated into darkness deety switched out all lights zeb reported set stop i called out i added zeb you reported set in total darkness how did you set it rotation around z axis with x and y dropping out duration along teh third combo first group sir i mean how did you do it in darkness by clicks captain i didnt do it in darkness i said it was pitch dark when you reported set so it was captain its not necessary to call me captain every ten seconds i want a straight answer so far you have reported that you set it in darkness and that you set it with lights on no sir god damn it you just did captain i protest your swearing at me i request that my protest be logged zeb you are i shut up i counted thirty in french under my breath by which time i was ready to speak zeb im sorry that my language offended you but i am still trying to find out what you did and how will you please tell me in simple language yes sir i set the third rotation by clicks but you said the lights were on the lights were on i set the rotation with my eyes closed for gods sake why for practice i set them with eyes closed then i check to see whether it matches what i intended to set deety leaves the light on until i give her the kill it sign
