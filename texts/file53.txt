could you reverse that go somewhere else and tell gay to come to you somewhere shes never been yes deety switched off her walkytalky and made sure that mine was off i dont want her to hear this zebadiah i always feel animistic about a computer the pathetic fallacyi know but gay is a person to me deety sighed i know its a machine it doesnt have ears it cant see it doesnt have a concept of spacetime what it can do is manipulate circuitry in complex wayscomplexities limited by its grammar and vocabulary but those limits are exact if i dont stay precisely with its grammar and vocabulary it reports null program i can tell it anything by radio that i can tell it by voice inside the cabinand so can you but i cant tell it to come look for me in a meadow beyond a canyon about twelve or thirteen klicks approximately southwest of herenow thats a null programfive undefined terms because you made it null you fed garbage in and expect me to be surprised at garbage outwhen you did it apurpose i did not either i didnt i kissed the end of her nose deety darling you should trust your instincts heres one way to tell gay to do that without defining even one new term into her vocabulary tell her to expect a threepart program first part bounce one minimum ten klicks second part transit twelve point five klicks true course twotwofive third part drop to one klick hoverg and hover at that point if what you described as your location is roughly correct you will see her and can coach her to a landing without using jakes twister uh twelve and a half kilometers cant be done in units often kilometers powered flight waste juice hon you just flunked high school geometry using euclids tools compass and straight edge lay out that course and distance then lay out how to get there in tenklick unitsno fractions my wife stared then her eyes cleared transit one minimum true course oneseventhree and two thirds then transit one minimum true course twosevensix and one third the mirror image solution uses the same courses in reverse plus endless trivial solutions using more than two minima go to the head of the class if you dont spot her have her do a retreating search curvein her perms in an aussie accent honey girl did you actually do that euclid style i approximated it euclid stylebut you didnt supply compass and straight edge scribe circle radius twelve point five bisect circle horizontally by straight edge through origin quarter it by dropping a vertical bisect lower left quadrantthat gives true course twotwofive or southwest then set compass at ten units and scribe arcs from origin and from southwest point of circle the intersections give courses and vertices for both major roots to the accuracy of your straight edge and compass but simply to visualize that constructionwell i got visualized angles of twosevenfive and onesevenfive pretty sloppy so i did it accurately by pythagorean proposition by splitting the isosceles triangle into two right triangles hypotenuse is ten one side is six and a quarterand that gives the missing side as seven point eightzerosixtwofourseven pluswhich gives you one course and you read off the other by the scandalous fifth axiom but i did check by trig arc sine point seveneightzerosixtwofourseven hold it i believe you what other ways can you program gay to find you using her present vocabulary uhurn juice if necessary i would have her bounce a minimum then maximize my signal home on me certainly now do the same thing without using juice just jakes twister deety looked thoughtful and about twelve years old then suddenly said drunkards walkadded at once but i would place a locus around the walk just large enough to be certain that im inside it gay should plot signal level at each vertex such a plot would pinpoint the signal source which way is faster home straight in under power or drunkards walk deety answered why thelooked startled those are solidstate relays jake sets verniers by handbut when gay is directing herself there are no moving parts solid state zebadiah am i thinking straight using power at that distancecall it twelve kilometersgay should be able to home on me in three or four minutes butzebadiah this cant be rightusing no power and relying on random numbers and pure chance in a drunkards walk gay should find me in less than a second where did i go wrong on the high side deety girl lost your nerve the first fifty milliseconds should show the hot spot in less than the second fifty shell part your hair all over in a tenth of a secondor less but honey we still havent talked about the best way i said that you should trust your instincts gay is not an it shes a person youll never know how relieved i was when it turned out that you two were going to be friends if she had been jealous of you may the gods deliver us from a vindictive machine but shes not she thinks youre swell zebadiah you believe that dejah thoris i know that deety looked relieved i know it toodespite what i said earlier deety to me the whole world is alive some parts are sleeping and some are dozing and some are awake but yawning and some are brighteyed and bushytailed and always ready to go gay is one of those yes she is im sorry i called her an it but what is this best way isnt it obvious dont tell her howjust tell her say to her gay come find me all four words are in her vocabulary the sentence is compatible with her grammar shell find you but how drunkards walk a tenth of a second might strike her as too longshe likes you hon shell look through her registers and pick
