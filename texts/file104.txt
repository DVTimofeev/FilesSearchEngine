purse or hers it was eighteen minutes from her message to our arrival at the governors officeand i had had a fifteenminute tub comfy if not sybaritic besides bertie and the brigadier that fathead moresby was there aunt hilda ignored him so i did bertie stood up how smart you all look did you have a pleasant day the poor dear looked dreadfulgaunt circles under his eyes a perfect daythanks to you thanks to the brigadier and thanks to a curly lamb named bean a fine lad squeaky boomed ill pass on your word if i may the brigadier did not look fresh i decided that neither had been to bed bertie waited until we were seated then got to business captain burroughs what are your plans aunt hilda did not answer his question she glanced toward major general moresby back at bertie we are not in private excellency hmm bertie looked unhappy moresby you are excused but dismissed you have work to do i feel sure moresby swelled up but got up and left squeaky bolted the outer door closed the inner door while bertie stood up to lift the rug over his recorder switch aunt hilda said dont bother bertie record if you need to whats the trouble old dear russians yes hilda you four are refugees yesterday you showed me why would you care to remain here my delegated power is sufficient that i can grant naturalization as fast as i can sign my signature no bertie but we feel greatly honored i expected that do reconsider it there are advantages to being a subject of the most powerful monarch in history in being protected by a flag on which the sun never sets no bertie captain hilda i need you and your ship because of millions of miles of distance many months required for a message i hold dejure viceregal power almost equal to sovereign and de facto greater in emergency because no parliament is here i can recruit foreign troops arm them make guarantees to them as if they were british award the kingemperors commission i would like to recruit all of you and your ship commodore for you captain for your secondincommand commander for your chief pilot lieutenant commander for your copilot retirement at full pay once the emergency is over return of your purchased ship as a royal gift after the emergency compensation for loss or damage one rank higher for each of you all four of us must be at least one rank senior to major general moresby hilda thats my own rank equivalent rankvice admiral bertie you cant hire us as mercenaries at any rank or pay that hyperbole was to tell you that we will not place ourselves under your chief of staff that settled what can we do to help you im afraid you cant since you wont accept the protection under international law of military status so im forced to cut the knot do you understand the right of angary i thought he said angry and wondered i believe so are great britain and the russias at war no but there are nuances shall i call in my legal officer not for me my own legal officer is here doctor zebadiah carter my consultant in international law doctor carteroh fiddlesticks my friend zeb zeb will you discuss the right of angary very well governor one nuance you had in mind was that in addition to wartime it applies to national emergencysuch as your current one with the russians yes angary has changed in application many times but in general it is the right of a sovereign power to seize neutral transport found in its ports or territory then use same in war or similar emergency when the emergency is over seized transport must be returned fair rentals must be paid loss or damage requires compensation it does not apply to goods or chattels and most especially not to persons thats the gist do we need your legal officer i dont think so captain burroughs we dont need him you intend
