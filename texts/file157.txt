be its time then kiss me and tell me you want to do this if you do oh i do very much there were kisses and tears all around i got pulled into it found myself kissing the prospective father i gave him a chance to duck but he didnt our busy little stranger was still playing ringmaster lazarus what is that guest room across the cabin pastel colors aurora room beloved husband wrap a towel around this sweet frightened child take her there lock the door behind you and make her happy this suite is the only totally private place in this ship if i lay eyes on either of you in less than one hour i shall burst into tears that doesnt mean you cant stay longer i hope that you will come to dinner but you are welcome to aurora room after dinner sweetheart you must give her at least one chance each of the next three days a womans timing can vary from her norm now git pick her up and carry her lib wouldnt let jake carry her but she leaned into his arm as they left the fresher she looked back with a happy smile and threw us a kiss hilda caught it and ate it then she said to me help me out please dear i lifted her out sat her on the edge climbed out myself she patted the padded deck said i think this is better than that chaise longue if we happen to be caught it wouldnt embarrass me and should not embarrass you in these circumstances jacob would be relieved rather than upset she smiled eased her sweet thighs put up her arms now yes anything you want including back rubs lazarus does it excite you knowing what is going on a few meters away it does me yes but i dont need ithilda youre superb not in looks certainly so i try hard with what i have sold myself three timesdid my best to make my contracthusbands each feel that he had received full valuehen married dear jacob for love and am trying still harder with him he is goodi mean he is good all through i hope elizabeth appreciates him youve had her yes before or after the change both i miss the before appreciate the after then why wont you knock her up thats a family joke she had her first child by me is now making the rounds of our family more or less woman you are not here to talkim almost there she looked delighted im climaxing steadily let er ripand bit my chin an indefinitely long time later that need not be detailed we were resting in each others arms enjoying that delicious peace of the ebbing tide hilda saw them first raised her head jacob beloved did you lib did my sweetheart put a baby in you did he hilda you do that every night little bitty like you less than two hours and darling jacob has worn me out im a hollow mockery dear built for it tell her jacob my darling is adaptable libby dear lazarus did hilda treat you nicely i died happy hes not deadhilda made a long arm cupped a handful of water threw it in my face giggled the suggestion she added i rejected with dignityas much dignity as one can manage when two women are tumbling one into a tub of waterhile ones male comrade stands by and laughs xliv where do we get the corpse zeb the question said my wife deety is where do we get the corpse with timing that precise gay can make the pickup but a corpse has to be left behind lazarus not only do your movies show it but you remember maureens death you went to her funeral its got to be a fresh corpse of an elderly woman that the cops will accept as maureen johnson six of usdeety me jake
