next rotation by touch and sound in the dark thats number eight third of second group aye aye captain bligh the tumble showed nothing jake switched on lights reported that sharpie had set the next rotation correctly deety asked me to relieve her at the conn then said science officer i am about to inspect the addition to your department please accompany me without a word sharpie did so they were gone quite a while at last i said jake what do women talk about in can conferences im afraid to find out they came back full of giggles i concluded that deetys disciplinary methods worked as they strapped down deety said dear its black as sin out there and sunlight streaming in both bathroom windows riddle me that science officers department i evaded stand by to rotate this time jake not only had air i could hear it jake got her leveled out hastily copilot haboveg thirteen hundred meters too close zeb im going to retire and take up tatting where are we i cant see a thing were over water pop with a light fog i see a shoreline to starboard jake turned gay to the right i picked out the shoreline gays wings were spread jake held her at an easy glide and placed her on automatic well leave this kite sealed now i wont check the air without going up high sail ho where away sharpie starboard bow a sailing ship durn if it wasnt a squarerigger out of the seventeenth century high forecastle and sterncastle jake took us down for a better look i wasnt afraid people who sail ships like that dont use guided missilesso i kept telling myself it was a pretty sight jake dropped the starboard wing so that we could have a good look but we must not have been a pretty sight to them sailors were rushing around and the helmsman let her get away from him and she fell into irons her canvas flapping foolishly not wanting to get the poor fellow keelhauled i told jake to level off and head for land deety said good god pop you scared me silly why deetycaptain deety they were scaredbut surely you arent scared by blackpowder cannon you almost put the starboard wing into the water dont be silly deety i was above two hundred meters well maybe a hundred and fifty when i did that steep turn but plenty of room take a look at your altimeter and pressure jake looked and so did i the radar altimeter stated that we were nineteen meters above the water jake had to change scales to read it pressure showed well over a thousand millibarsa sealevel high so i snapped gay bounce gay did and i caught my breath deety how did i make that error jake asked i dont know pop i can see the right wing tip you cant when it looked to me as if you might cut the water i looked at the instruments i was about to yell when you straightened out captain i was driving seatofmypants by the ships masts i would swear i never got within three hundred meters of that ship on the slant that should put me plenty high sharpie said jacob dont you recognize this place hilda dont tell me youve been here before only in books beloved a childs version in third grade a more detailed version in junior high finally i laid hands on the unexpurgated version which was pretty racy for the age i was then i still find it pleasantly bawdy sharpie i demanded what are you talking about jake answered zeb what sort of ship could cause me to think i was high in the air when in fact i was about to polevault into the sea ive got it said deety i give up i admitted tell him pop one manned by sailors fifteen centimeters high i thought about it we were approaching land i told jake to glide to two klicks by instrument and told gay to hold us thereit seemed much higher if anyone runs across dean swift will you give him a swift kick for me deety said zebadiah do you suppose the land of the giantsbrobdingnagis on this continent i hope not why not dear it should be fun we dont have time to waste on either lilliputians or giants neither would have obstetricians able to take care of you two sharpie get ready to take us up a hundred thousand klicks then to rotate does anyone have any theory about what has been happening to us aside from sharpies notion that we are dead and dont know it i have another theory zebbie give sharpie dont laughbecause you told me that you and jacob discussed the heart of it the idea that human thought exists as quanta i dont know quanta from qantas airways but i know that a quantum is an indivisible unit you told me that you and jacob had discussed the possibility that imagination had its own sort of indivisible units or quantayou called them fictonsor was it ficta either way the notion was that every story ever toldor to be told if there is a differenceexists somewhere in the number of the beast but hilda my love that was merely abstract speculation jacob your colleagues regard this car as abstract speculation didnt you tell me that the human body is merely complex equations of wave forms that was when i bit youi dont mind being a wave form waves ares pretty i bit you for using the adverb merely zebadiah there is a city on the left shouldnt we look at it before we leave captain you must decide that you saw what a panic we caused in that ship imagine yourself fourteen centimeters tall and living in that city along comes a great sky monster and dives on you would you like it how many little people
