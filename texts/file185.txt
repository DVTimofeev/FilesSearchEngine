tapped zeb on the shoulder i heard those introductions come along carter spectacles to fit my forward stalks that see through the thickest mist he put them on looked around him they clarify any there get him grab him that beast get his number without a lost instant deety hilda and lazarus closed on the agentand were left with torn clothes and plastic splints as the thing got loose the special agent vaulted over the bar was seen again almost instantly at the far end of the bar jumped up on it leapt for the canvas top grabbed hold of the edge of the illusion hole swung itself up bounded for bifrost reached it sir isaac newton played mellrooney the worst troublemaker in all the worlds lazarus i never expected to find that beast in your quiet retreat nor did i until i heard all of zebs story this convention was called expecially to entice him and it did but we lost him we lost him but i got its number hilda said and held out its shield  the fleeing figure dark against the rainbow
