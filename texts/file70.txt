candy bars everybody grab one for quick energyunless somebody remembers where they were packed gay knows said deety and backed toward the cars open door while still keeping her eyes swinging the arc away from the riverperfect sentry and looking cute at it gay deceiver hi deety getting any inventory food supplies candy milky way bars report location frame twenty starboard closed storage sevenesshigh bottom shelf five hours later everything was back inside except a heap of wrapping packaging and suchyet the increase in space was far greater than that pile this was because storage did not have to be logical just tell gay a left shoe could fill an odd space in with the swords while the right shoe from the same pair was a space filler in a tool storage far to the rearyet the only inconvenience lay in having to go to two places to get them i did the stowing deety stayed in the cabin received items handed from outside described the item to gay then described to gay where the item was stowed as i reported it gay was under instruction to hear only deetys voice and what deety told gay was so logical that no one need remember it like this gay deceiver boss when will you learn to say please clothing zeb shoes field boots right boot abaft bulkhead starboard frame forty under deckplate outboard compartment left boot abaft bulkhead portside frame sixty under deckplate middle compartment warning both boots filled with rifle ammo padded with socks you see if you got categories in the wrong order gay would restring them give her the basic category and the identification leaving out the other steps and gay would search the tree deetys words and get the twig you identified you could even fail to give category and she would search until she found it but hardest was to build up the decking of the rear compartment about twenty centimeters with chattels or stores that would not crush fasten it down to keep it from floating in free fall and make it smooth enough that it would not be unbearably lumpy as a bedwhile making some effort neither to build into this platform nor to store in compartments under it things needed frequently or quickly i had to lower my standards it is impossible to store so many things in such limited space and have all readily at hand i studied things outside admitted that i could not do it then asked for advice zebbie solved it captain do a dry run uho on zebbie take my sleeping bag inside open it out it is too wide for the space especially at the rear so keep it as far forward as you can and still miss jakes twister and the bulkhead door mark the amount you have to lap it mark on the deck the foot of the openedout bag youll find space abaft that frustum of a cone sort of drag the sleeping bag outside mark the tuckin build your platform on it then fill that rear space and build a bulkhead better get jake hes a born mechanic zebbie would you prefer to build this bed yourself nope why not im not speaking as captain im inquiring as your old friend sharpie because im twice as big as you which makes that space half as big for me tell you what capn sharpieexcuse mecaptain hildado the measuring meanwhile well pick out plunder that might be bricks in that platform then drag the sleeping bag outside if youll let jake relieve me deety and i can piece together the platform in jig time it changed impossible to possible the cubbyhole was filled contents held in place with openedout cartons tied with wire to hoddownspadeyes jacob called them the platform was built chinked with this and that covered with more flattenedout cartons and topped off with sleeping bag and blankets it was still light deety assured me that there was one hour and fortythree minutes till sundown time enough if we hurry jacob first bath deety guard him both come back so jacob can start dinnerthen zebbie and deety go downgoodness this sounds like the farmer and the rowboat with the fox and the geeseand bathe taking turns guarding both come back deety relieves me zebbie takes me down to bathe while he guards but please hurry i want a bath too forty minutes before sundown bathing stops and we eat at sundown we are inside dirty dishes and all locked in till sunrise if that does me out of a bath we still hold to it jacob how far is this easy way down i mean how many minutes maybe five hilda my love if you werent insisting on alwaystwotogether there would be no hurry all go down together i hurry through my bath grab my rifle and trot back the rest neednt hurry youve got us going down and up down and up four timesforty minutes which squeezes four baths into twenty minutes five minutes to undress soap squat down and rinse off towel dry and dress hardly worth the trip jacob who guards you while youre getting supper no i can bathe in the morning damn i wanted that bath im used to a shower in the morning a tub at night a bidet at any excuse decadentthats me beloved this place is safe while we were out earlier zeb and i scouted for sign none thats when we found this way down to the creek it would be a natural watering place no sign i dont think there are any large fauna here i was wavering when deety spoke up pop thats three downandups not four as zebadiah and i get baths on one but captain hilda if we all go down and come back together there cant be danger put that stuff back inside and lock up of course she pointed at jacobs preparations while jacob had been handing stuff
