stop is for anything you want to look at more than three seconds maybe it looks promising and a few seconds more will let you decide but please everyone there should not be more than a dozen calls for stop in the hour any more questions we started hilda gave the first bingo i saw it toofarm buildings aunt hilda is faster than i i almost broke my own injunction i had to bite down on stop the temptation to take a longer look was almost overpowering all of us made mistakesbut none serious hilda racked up the most bingoes and zebadiah the fewestbut im fairly certain that my husband was cheating by waiting to give pop or me first crack at it he would not be competing with aunt hilda portforward and starboardafter seats have little overlapping coverage i thought it would be tedious instead it was excitingbut dreadfully tiring slowly less than one a minute bright dots appeared on the display i saw with disappointment that most bingoes were clustered adjacent to the irregular margin marking russian territory it seemed probable that these marked russian territory so very probable that it hardly seemed worthwhile to check for onion spires once my husband called stop and then bingo at a point north and far west at least fifteen hundred kilometers from the nearest bingo light i noted the timegreenwich then tried to figure out why zebadiah had stopped us it was pretty country green hills and lightly wooded and i spotted a wild stream not a canal but i saw no buildings or anything suggesting settlement zebadiah wrote something on his knee pad then said continue i was itching to ask why he had stopped but when a decision must be made every three seconds there is no time to chat when the hour was nearly up a single bingo light in the far west that had been shining since the first five minutes was joined by another when hilda scored another bingo and two minutes later pop said bingo and we had an equilateral triangle twenty kilometers on a side i noted the time most carefullythen told myself not to be disappointed if inspection showed onion towers we still had a hemisphere to go i decided to believe in that british colony the way one has to believe hard in fairies to save tinker bells life if there were no british colony we might have to risk earthwithoutaj gay deceiver was a lovely car but as a spaceship she had shortcomings no plumbing air for about four hours and no way to recycle no plumbing limited food storage no plumbing no comfortable way to sleep in her no plumbing but she had talents no other spaceship had her shortcomings according to my father and husband could be corrected at any modern machine shop but in the meantime we did not have even an outhouse behind the barn at last gay stopped continued to display and announced one hour of a tramp abroad completed instructions please gay bounce said zebadiah deety i dont think weve nailed down the piece the sun never sets on but this dense cluster here to the right too close to the little fathers little children eh yes zebadiah i should tell gay to trim the locus on the east to eliminate the clustered lights and now we can add almost nine hundred kilometers on the west to the present sunrise line gay can rotate the display to show the added area i suspect that one more hour will fill in the picture sufficiently maybe even less you were right three seconds is not only a long time it is excessively long isnt two seconds enough can you change that without starting from scratch yes to both captain good you can add thirty degrees on the west instead of fifteen because we are going to kill an hourstretch our legs eat a snack and i for one want to find a bush how do i tell gay to return to a particular bingo or will that mess up your program not a bit tell her to return to bingo suchandsuch stating the time i was unsurprised when he said gay return to bingo greenwich twentyone sixteen fiftyone it was indeed a pretty stream zebadiah said happily that beats burning juice who sees a clearing close to that creek big enough for gay hover and squat i mean i dont dare make a glide landing dead stickthe old girl is loaded zebbie im sober as you are dont boast about it sharpie i think i see a spot close your eyes im going to i almost wish i had zebadiah came in on a long glide everything set for maximum liftbut no power i kept waiting for that vibration that meant that gay was alive and roaring and waited and waited he said gay and i thought that he was going to tell her to turn herself on no we actually dropped below the level of that bank then he suddenly switched on power by hand but in reverseflipped us up on that bank we stalled and dropped perhaps a meterwe just barely missed that bank i didnt say anything aunt hilda was whispering hail mary mother of god om mani padme hum there is no god but god and mahomet is his prophet then some language i did not know but it sounded very sincere pop said son do you always cut it that fine i saw a man do it that way when he had to ive always wondered if i could but what you didnt know wasgay are you listening sure thing boss you alerted me wheres the riot youre a smart girl gay then why am i pushing this baby carriage gay go to sleep sleepy time roger and out boss jake what you didnt know was that i had my cheeks puffed to say b  u n c e explosively
