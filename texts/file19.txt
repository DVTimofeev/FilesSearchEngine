it was signed jake uhmy dear hilda a hasty ps to my phone call of yesterdaywould you be so kind as to include doctor neil o brain chairman of mathematics i dont know what possessed me that i forgot to mention him probably the pleasure of hearing your dear voice deety sends her love as do i ever yours jacob j burroughs with jake signed above the typed name zebadiah said to me watson you know my methods certainly my dear holmes a black hat in logan we knew that what new data well pop made that call from the house i remember it so somebody has a tap on our phone had i mean the fire probably destroyed it a recording tap the purpose of that fire may have been to destroy it and other evidence for now we know that the blokes in the black hats knew that your fatherand you but its pop they are afterwas in california last evening after killing him in california they destroyed all they could in utah professor i predict that we will learn that your office was robbed last nightany papers on sixdimensional spaces pop shrugged they wouldnt find much i had postponed my final paper after thehumiliatingreception my preliminary paper received i worked on it only at home or here and moved notes made in logan to our basement here each time we came down any missing here i am certain this place has not been entered not that papers would matter i have it in my head the continua apparatus has not been touched zebadiah is doctor brain a black hat i asked i dont know deety he may be a stooge in their hire but hes part of their plot or they would not have risked forging a letter to put him into hildas house jake how difficult is it to steal your professional stationery not difficult i dont keep a secretary i send for a stenographer when i need one i seldom lock my office when im on campus deety can you scrounge pen and paper i want to see how jake signs jake sure i fetched them pops signature is easy i often sign it i hold his power of attorney its the simple signatures that are hardest to forge well enough to fool a handwriting expert but their scheme did not require fooling an expertphrasing the note was more difficultince hilda accepted it as ringing true it does ring true son it is very like what i would have said had i written such a note to hilda the forger probably has read many of your letters and listened to many of your conversations jake will you write jake four or five times the way you sign a note to a friend pop did so my husband studied the specimens normal variations zebadiah then signed jake about a dozen times looked at his work took a fresh sheet signed jake once passed it to aunt hilda well sharpie aunt hilda studied it it wouldnt occur to me to question iton jacobs stationary under a note that sounded like his phrasing where do we stand now stuck in the mud but we have added data at least three are involved two black hats and doctor brain who may or may not be a black hat he is at minimum a hired hand an unwitting stooge or a puppet they can move around like a chessman while two plus brainy is minimum it is not the most probable number this scheme was not whipped up overnight it involves arson forgery boobytrapping a car wiretapping theft and secret communications between points widely separated with coordinated criminal actions at each endand it may involve doing in my cousin zebulon we can assume that the black hats know that i am not the zeb carter who is the ndimensional geometer im written off as a bystander who got himself killed which doesnt bother them these playful darlings would swat a fly with a sledgehammer or cure a cough with a guillotine they are smart organized efficient and viciousand the only clue is an interest in sixdimensional noneuclidean geometry we dont have a glimmer as to whoother than doctor brain whose role is unclear but jake i think i know whyand that will lead us to who why zebadiah i demanded princess your father could have worked on endless other branches of mathematics and they would not have bothered him but he happenedi dont mean chance i dont believe in chance in this sensehe worked on the one variety of the endless possible number of geometriesthe only one that correctly describes how spacetime is put together having found it because he is a genius in both theory and practice he saw that it was a means by which to build a simple craftamazingly simple the greatest invention since the wheela spacetime craft that offers access to all universes to the full number of the beast plus undenumerable variations of each of those many universes we have one advantage i dont see any advantage theyre shooting at my jacob one strong advantage sharpie the black hats know that jake has worked out this mathematics they dont know that he has built his spacetime tailtwister they think he has just put symbols on paper they tried to discredit his work and were successful they tried to kill him and barely missed they probably think jake is deadand it seems likely that they have killed ed but they dont know about snug harbor why do you say that zeb oh i hope they do notbut why do you feel sure because these blokes arent fooling they blew up your car and burned your flat what would they do hereif they knew an abomb son do you think that criminals can lay hands on atomic weapons jake these arent criminals a criminal is a member of the subset of the larger set human beings these
