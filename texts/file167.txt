brought their swords down as soon as hilda stopped and faced in pop commanded corporal bronson front and center lazarus jerked as if he had been struck holstered his pistol marched to the far end making sharp corners in passing around the wardroom table he halted facing hildashe may have given him some sign dora hit two bugle notes aunt hilda sang shipmates beloved friends tonight we are greatly honored four rufflesandflourishes as the drapes lifted and parted and again lights picked out bare skin this time against a forestgreen backing maureen in operalength black stockings green round garters dark shoes with semihigh heels her long red hair down her back maureen was not standing tall she was in the oldest and most graceful of sculptors poses left knee slightly bent weight slightly more on her right foot chest lifted only a little but displaying her full teats nipples heavily crinkled her smile was happy she held pose while that march concluded then in the sudden silence held out her arms and called theodore corporal bronson fainted xlvii there are no tomorrows zeb sharpie shouldnt have done it to lazarus for a veteran of sixteen wars and koshchei alone knows how many skirmishes and narrow escapes to be placed in a position where he is so shocked that blood drains from his head and he collapses aint fitten deety agrees but asks me if i could have refrained from staging mama maureens return that way given the chance well no had i sharpies imaginationbut it still would not have been fitten not that he was hurt by it sharpie all fortythree kilos of her checked his fall she was watching lazarus saw him start to collapse closed the gap and grabbed him around the waist did her best sharpie saved him from hitting his head on the wardroom table i would bet long odds that everyone was looking at maureen except sharpie sharpie had staged itand the producer was interested in the effect on the one for whom it had been staged she had staged it even to the extent of getting libby to ask ishtar to obtain costumeshoes hose and round green garters to match a photograph plus a hooded cape to keep our ubiquitous snoop dora from knowing that we had an extra aboard sharpie had figured this way that french photo snapshot of mama maureen yeah i call her that tooshes the most motherly person in any world and the sexiest dont mention the last to deety deety knows it eeythat snapshot was still in existence unless destroyed by machinegun fire in  earthprime which it would not be because lazarus got his arse shot off as his sisters describe it not literally true it was a belly wound more than bullets in his arse that came that close to finishing him but all the wounds were low where does a man in combat carry his most cherished possessions in a breast pocket usually the left one i always have and ive never heard a veteran deny this it might be worth it to faint in order to wake up surrounded by maureen hilda lazlor elizabeth and my own reason for being jake and i could have played several hands of gin before anyone bothered with us so i asked dora for drinks and snacks for jake and me as it seemed uncertain as to when dinner would be served or if i heard sharpie say maureen we must get this heavy uniform off him dora keeps this ship tropical i should never have ordered uniforms for men while we women are comfortable they started peeling him i said jake schools out i had sweated through my numberone uniform might never wear it again but im sentimental about it jake was in as bad shape once you get happy with skin any clothes make you feel like rameses ii we peeled down and handed our clothes and swords to one of doras waldoes and told her to hand them to gayincluding jakes pistol belt and holster which i retrieved without anyone noticing me jake and i were chinese stage hands corporal ted bronson was getting all the attention dora pointed out that gay was locked i said if one of her doors were open could you lay this gear on a seat yes she could then do it i said let me talk to gay we eventually had dinner with everybody formal but maureen she retained her casual clothing long after everyone else was in formal skin but not until i got pix of the four disgraces libby and deety wanted to go shower too when jake and i decided that having discarded uniforms we should shower in fairness to doras airconditioning i asked them and lazlor please to wait until i staggered down we had encountered a forcefour sea with white caps to gay for jakes polaroid turned out not to be necessary dora could take color and d still or motion any angle and light as needed just as she had lighted the posing which she had photographed too i learned later maureen and jake directed while corporal bronson and i sprawled nerostyle on lounges intended for lib and deety sharpie sat between us and dropped grapes into our mouths jake tried to make the poses artistic mama maureen agreed with everything jake said then did it her way the results may have been artistic but i know that those pix would give a skeleton one last case of raging tumescence meanwhile dora was singing and playing urging us to eattasty tidbits eaten with tongs i was reminded of the best in oriental cuisinesand plying us with fine wines dora seemed to have a vast repertoire some of which to my surprise was familiar when judy garland sings over the rainbow who can miss itdora used judys voice i recall too enjoy yourself its later than you think most of them i did not know
