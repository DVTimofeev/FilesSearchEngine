of it gay deceiver did most of it the car you rode in both ways but we almost didnt pick you up things went wrong badly i knew that it was going to deety can you tell her mama maureen zebadiah has forerunners of dangers they are not long range they are always just barely in time i dont know what happened this morning but this morning maureen looked extremely puzzled oh my wife went on it was

metal mentalities incorporated to measure that space male computers you cant scare me  buddy boy you wouldnt trust your dirty neck to a male computer stupid my neck isnt dirty thats just where the collar of my uniform rubbed it dirty neck and a dirty mind but dont worry  buddy boy dora long doesnt tell secrets i now see that gay had to keep secrets tooi just hadnt thought about it but you were mean to my sisters me how you knew about this caper you didnt need to get it from gay you knew all about it you were there but you held out on your own twin sisters most unfairly mama maureen as if we were untrustworthy and if were untrustworthy why can we be trusted with a ship and the lives of everyone on board were glad you are here for yourself but maybe now that you are here you will protect us from his tyranny mama ishtar doesnt and mama hamadryad just laughs at us and mama minerva takes his side everytime but you girls yes mama i made a promise to myself years ago that when my children grew up i would not interfere in their lives i should have punished woodie more frequently when he was a child but he is no longer a child then why does he act like one lorelei lee it is rude to interrupt im sorry mama no harm done but from what i was told at home you two are not only my daughters but are also theodores wives wives of lazarus and equally wives of his cohusbands is this not true yes mama but hes pretty chinchy about it if you mean chinchy in bed it may depend on how you treat him i
