i did one then six then a whole field of them i was explaining to god that i didnt like this dream so please let me wake up when brian had the conductor halt the contraption and i saw that there were men in that field too the men carried whips vermin were muzzled this one verminwell wogthis wog had managed to pull its muzzle aside and was stuffing this weedy plant into its mouth when a whip cracked across its naked back it cried the field on the other side of the road was not being worked so i stared at it after a while i heard brian say captain hilda you are serious really didnt the brigadier authorize it ah yes i thought he was pulling my leg very well maam i had to see what this was all about and discovered that muzzled vermin afraid of men with whips werent frightening they were merely ugly aunt hilda was taking pictures movies and stereo brian was talking to a man dressed like any farmer except for the broad arrow brian turned and said captain hilda the foreman asks that you point out the wog you want to dissect aunt hilda answered there has been a mistake maam you dont want to dissect a wog leftenant i was told that one or more died or was slaughtered each day i want to dissect a dead body in an appropriate place with surgical instruments and other aids i have no wish to have one of these poor creatures killed we left shortly brian said of the two the abattoir and the infirmary i suggest the latter the veterinarian is a former harley street specialist by the bye there is no case of humans contracting disease from these brutes so the infirmary isnt dangerous just ah unpleasant we went to the wog hospital i did not go inside shortly pop came out looking green he sat beside me and smiled wanly deety the captain ordered me outside for fresh airand i didnt argue arent you proud of me i told him that im always proud of my pop a few minutes later brian and zebadiah came out with a message from hilda that she expected to work at least another hour possibly longer captain hilda suggests that i take you for a drive brian reported the drive was only as far as the nearest pub the sillywagon was sent back to wait for the hillbilly we waited in the lounge where pop and brian had whisky and splash and zebadiah ordered a shandygaffso i did too it will never replace the dry martini i made it last till aunt hilda showed up brian asked where now captain hilda imperial house brian youve been most kind i said capn auntie did you whittle one to pieces not necessary deetikins theyre chimpanzees youve insulted every chimp that ever lived deety these creatures bear the relation to black hats that a chimpanzee does to a man the physical resemblance is closer but the difference in mental power doctor wheatstone removed the brain from a cadaver that told me all i needed to know but i got something that may be invaluable motion pictures zebadiah said sharpie you took motion pictures in the fields true zebbie but i have with me the polaroids you took for me at snug harbor some show the splints that creature used to disguise its extra knees and elbows doctor wheatstone used surgical splints to accomplish the same with one of his helpersa docile and fairly intelligent wog that didnt object even though it fell down the first time it tried to walk while splinted but it caught on and managed a stifflegged walk just like that rangerand like brainy now that i think about itthen was delighted when doctor wheatstone dressed it in trousers and an old jacket those pictures will surprise you no makeup no plastic surgery a hastily improvised disguisefrom the neck down it looked human when we reached imperial house we transferred packages into gay deceiveragain were not permitted to carry brian told the conductor the conductor told his crew we thanked them thanked brian as we said goodbye and aunt hilda expressed a hope of seeing him soon and we echoed herme feeling like a hypocrite he saluted and started toward the officers club we headed for the big wide steps aunt hilda said deety want to share some soap suds sure thing i agreed whuffor asked zebadiah sharpie you didnt get a spot on you to remove the psychic stink zebbie mine isnt psychic i said i stink i do but damn spit and dirty socks we had hardly climbed into that tub when a message arrived relayed by my husband saying that the governor requested us to call at his office at our earliest convenience sharpie hon let me translate that based on my eighty years man and boy as flunky to an ambassador means bertie wants to see us five minutes ago i started to climb out aunt hilda stopped me i understood it zebbie i speak officialese campusese and bureaucratese but ill send a reply in clear english female idiom is a messenger waiting yes a major a major eh that will cost bertie five extra minutes zebbie i learned before you were born that when someone wants to ee me in a hurry the urgency is almost never mutual all right message the commanding officer of spacecraft gay deceiver sends her compliments to the governor general and will call on him at her earliest convenience then give the major a message from you to bertie that you happen to know that im taking a bath and that you hope ill be ready in twenty minutes but that you wouldnt wager even money on thirty okay except that the word should be respects not compliments also the major emphasized that he wants to see all of us want jake and me
