em together instead teena picks my brain while i snooze minerva does the dirty work shes the managing partner threeway split how about it girls ive got no use for money im a computer and i dont know anything about business minerva protested you can learn jubal assured her talk to anne teena dont play stupid in only three quintillion nanoseconds or less you are going to want new clothes and jewelry and satan knows what youll be glad your sister minerva has saved and invested your share of the net minerva added lazarus besides anne talk to deety not hilda hilda would show you how to make even more money but she would grab voting control meanwhile lets shake a leg hazel is expecting us and im thirsty agreed harshaw what were you saying about academic degrees oh lazarus looked at his printout as they walked it turns out that the degree of doctor is so common on that list of my special guests as to be not worth noting listen to this asimov benford biggie bone broxon cargraves challenger chater coupling coster dorosin douglas doyle dula forward fu giblett gunn harshaw hartwell haycock hedrick hoyle kondo latham macrae martin mott nourse oberhelman passovoy pinero pournelle prehoda richardson rothman sagan scortia schmidt sheffield slaughter smith stonehazel and edithtame watson williamsonthere are more thats just the addon printout and heres another double paradox the doctors hartwell and the doctors benford are arriving tomorrow and thereby missing the dull opening plenary obviously they are used to conventions jubal why is it that the speaker who knows least talks longest isnt that diracs corollary to murphys law but lazarus according to this program you have not only invited critics but have provided them with special facilities may i ask why i dont mind eating with publishersmost publishers editors have their place tooalthough i wouldnt want my sister to marry one but isnt this extreme instead of answering at once lazarus said where did minerva go athene replied were finishing off uncle tobias shell be along later ive told galahad thanks teena privacy mode jubal two guns three candy barswhere lafe earlier she was resting in the bottom of that pool has a young man named mike visited here lately your foster son the martian preacher no well i dont think so one of the things i learned from him was to postpone indefinitely anything i could not explainhile accepting the fact we were speaking of critics i asked why you were pampering them they walked the length of the atrium in the older south wing before lazarus replied jubal suppose i had refused to sell memberships to critics what would have happened hrrrmph they would crawl out of the woodwork so instead i gave them free passes and a fancy lounge with plenty of typewriters remarkable decorations you must see them by asking athene for displaydont go into that lounge you are not a critic mr hoag will be checking credentials book reviewers cant get past him so dont you try i wouldnt be found dead there you wouldnt be found avoid it it is clearly marked both above its door and on this program map and hoag you can spot by his prissy appearance and dirty fingernails youll note the stairscritics are above the rest of us there are thirteen steps up to their lounge thirteen lafe do i whiff something lazarus shrugged i dont know that the designer planned that number mobyas toras do you know him uh mars yes but not your mars or mine different universe and one of the most exciting barsoom mobyas is court mathematician to the warlord and took special interest in thisjob because of the way selfanointed critics have treated erb did i say that mobyas is a topologist possibly the best erbs universe is no harder to reach than any other and mars is in its usual orbit but that does not mean that you will find jolly green giants and gorgeous red princesses dressed only in jewels unless invited you are likely to find a potemkin village illusion tailored to your subconscious jubal the interior of the critics lounge is somewhat like a klein bottle so i hearive never been in it its singularity is not apparentas you will see from teenas displaysas it was decorated by a very great artist escher aha yes he and mobyas are old friendstwo immortals of similar tastes they have worked together many times i promised critics free entrance i made no mention of exit i promised them typewriters and tape recorders i did not promise typewriter ribbons or recorder tapes i promised them their own private bar no charges wouldnt be fair to charge as the bar has no liquor in it there is a lavish dining room but no kitchen lafe wouldnt it have been kinder to have liquidated them who said i wanted to be kind to them they wont starve their commissary is by the kilkenny cats method it should please them they are used to human flesh and enjoy drinking bloodsome i suspect of eating their young but jubal there is an easy way out for any critic who is even half as smart as he thinks he is go on he has to be able to read he has to be able to read his own language understand it not distort the meaning if he can read he can walk out at once lazarus shrugged but so few critics ever learn to read heres the big top harshaw looked far to the right far to the left how big is it ive been afraid to ask lazarus admitted that sign is bigger than most circus tops jubal stopped to read it the first centennial convention ofthe interuniversal society for eschatological pantheistic multipleego solipsism beautiful lafe how did you think it up i didnt it just grew and i dont understand it never mind mine host there will be ten thousand
