would wrangle with each other and appeal to the men for supportcrosswise jacob what is random is it correct to say that random is shorthand for i dont know deety said scornfully dont let her trap you pop shes got the second law of thermodynamics mixed up with the second law of roboticsand doesnt understand either one i had to phrase this and insist deety didnt want to say it deety is sweet not the bitch i am random is used a number of ways my love but it usually means a set in which the members are equal in probability of experiencing some event such as being next to be chosen if theyre chosen how can it be random deety snickered zebbie said dont let him snow you sharpie random means i dont knowas you said aunt hilda pay no attention to zebadiah random is what you have when you maximize entropy now daughter that is hardly a mathematical statement pop if i gave it to her in mathematical language shed faint deety quit picking on sharpie zebbie said sternly i wasnt picking on her hillbilly has this silly notion that we didnt get anywhere hunting vermin because we went about it systematicallyut every time we told gay to shake up her random numbers and do as she pleased we got results well didnt we i put in intentionally shrill we had endless failuresut every time we gave gay her headput her on random numbers as deety sayswe never had a failure random and chance are not related random chance is a nonsense expression auntie darling youre out of your skull dont worry pop pregnant women often get the vapors  indignantly listed things that could not be random or chancethen discovered that deety and i had to start dinner we left them wrangling and were careful not to giggle within earshot after dinner instead of that tired toast jacob said hilda would you explain your concept of random zeb and i have been discussing it and agree that there is some factor in our adventures not subject to analysis jake thats your statement i just said i dunno and wiped the drool off my chin tell us sharpie but jacob told us a month ago there isnt any such thing as chance its a way of admitting ignorance i thought that i had begun to understand it when we started hitting storybook universes lilliput oz dr smiths world wonderland i was so sure of it you remember three weeks ago after our second visit to oz i ordered a day of rest we spent it on tau axis instead of teh dullest day we had said zebbie you put us in orbit around mars not just one mars but dozens hundreds the only one worth a fiat dollar was the one we arent going back to i got permission to go off duty and take a nap you werent on duty zebbie you three slept or read or played crib but i was searching for barsoom not hundreds zebbiethousands i didnt find it hillbilly you didnt tell me dejah thoris why bother to say that i had been chasing the wild goose i swallowed my disappointment next day we started searching teh axis and wound up here would i have found barsoom had i asked gay to run the search defined her limits yesas zebbie did on marstenbut having defined it told her to take her random numbers and find it it worked on marsten we mapped a whole planet in a few hours it worked on teh axis why wouldnt it be best for another search jacob answered dearest zeb fed gay a defined locus but how would that apply to this uh speculative search jacob zebbie told us that gay holds the aerospace almanac that includes details about the solar system does it not more than i want to know zebbie agreed so gay knows the solar system i went on i thought of reading the barsoom stories to gay tell her to treat them as surface conditions on the fourth planetthen take her random numbers and find it jacob said gently beloved the autopilot doesnt really understand english she does in oz my husband looked startled jacob has immense imaginationll in one direction unless one jogs him zebbie caught it faster sharpie you would be loading her with thousands of bytes unnecessarily deety if theyve got those novels on new earthill find outwhat do you need to abstract in order to add to gays registers an exact description of barsoom so that gay can identify itand stop her drunkards walk dont need books my stepdaughter answered got em up here she touched her pretty strawberryblonde curls mmmo to sleep thinking about it tell it to gay early tomorrow before i speak to anybody minimum bytes no errors uh no appetizer a great sacrifice merely for science a oneeyed texas honeybutter stacknd the prospect of meeting the original dejah thoris never wears anything but jewels and is the most beautiful woman of two planets about that stackjanes buttermilk recide of course youre not interested in the most beautiful woman of two planets im a growing boy and aint about to be trapped into damaging admissions zebbie stopped to kiss deetys retrouss nose and added sharpie gay cant handle the full number of the beast and anyhow jake locked off most of it whats the reduced number jake deety promptly said six to the sixth fortysix thousand six hundred fiftysix zebbie shook his head still too many deety said sweetly zebadiah would you care to bet wench have you been monkeying with gay zebadiah you put me in charge of programming i have not changed her circuitry but i learned that she has four registers of random numbers accessible in rotation a notion of my own deety give them down time keep entropy at maximum deety did not answer her face assumed her noexpression her nipples were
