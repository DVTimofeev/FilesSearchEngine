shes part of your ships company yes yes i agreed astrogator and secondincommand doctor d t burroughs carter my wife well my congratulations sir thank you i say carter would it be rude of me to ask why the ladies have the senior posts while you and doctor burroughs appear to be junior or am i intruding not at all colonel we each do what we do best mrs burroughs is not only best as commander she is also best cook while we take turns at cooking ill happily volunteer as scullery maid if it will persuade the captain to cook amazing could you use a colonel of lancers about to retire im a wonderful scullery maid the dinner was excellent irish chef transported for shooting his landlord and lady herbert was delightful even though she drank her dinner and her words became increasingly difficult to understand but any answer would do as long as it was friendly jake displayed the charm he can when he bothers and kept her laughing one thing marred it lady herbert started to slump and nursing sisters appeared and took her away what is protocol for this i checked hilda and the governor they didnt seem to see it i glanced at hirdjones the brigadier did not seem to see itbut squeaky sees everything ergo no member of the colony could see it someone else gathered the ladies while the gentlemen remained for port and cigars while we were standing as the ladies left hirdjones leaned close your captain has asked me to tell you that the governor invites you to join them later in his study i tasted the port lit the cigar i dont smokefake it when polite when the brigadier caught my eye and said now bertie had left leaving a stooge a wit who had them all laughingthat colonel of lancers when jake and i came in deety and hilda were there with a large man tall as i am and heaviermajor general moresby chief of staff bertie stood while waving us to chairs thanks for coming gentlemen we are settling tomorrows schedule and your captain prefers to have you present the governor reached behind him moved out a globe of mars captain i think i have marked the places we visited yesterday deety please check it sharpie directed my darling looked it over the russian settlements extended almost one hundred fifty kilometers farther east than this borderline showsninetyone english miles seventynine nautical milescall it two and a half degrees impossible the bulky major general deety shrugged might be a few miles more all we took were spot checks jake said general moresby you had better believe it bertie stepped in with is that the only discrepancy doctor deety one more but there is something i want to ask about may i borrow a marking pen grease pencil bertie found one she placed three bingoes in an equilateral triangle well detached from both zones what are these sir this one is a village the other two are large farms but we did not determine nationality bertie looked at her marks not ours moresby how long ago did we reconnoitre that area there are no russians there shes doing it by memory shes mistaken i said moresby ill bet my wifes marks are accurate within two kilometers how high do you want to go what is a pound worth here in gold bertie said please gentlemenwagers another time what was the other error astrogator deety our touchdown point where we tangled with the russians your memory is off by many degrees should be here moresby governor that is impossible either they did not land there or they had trouble with russians somewhere else deety shrugged governor i have no interest in arguing our time of arrival at touchdown just after dawn day before yesterday was fourteenohsix in the afternoon windsor city local time six past two pip emma you saw the remains of that ornithopter today what did shadows and height of the sun tell you as to local time there and what does that tell you about longitude from here  she added with one degree of longitude being four minutes of local time difference you can treat one minute of arc as equal to one kilometer and measure it on this globe the errors will be smaller than your own error in estimate of local time astrogator im not good at this sort of problem but it was about eightthirty in the morning where we saw the burned ornithopter thats right governor well lay that out as kilometers and see how close it comes to my mark moresby objected but that globe is scaled in miles deety looked back at bertie with a half smile an expression that said wordlessly hes your boy bertie not mine bertie said testily moresby have you never worked with a french ordnance map im not as tolerant as deety multiply by onepointsixohnine thanks but we will assume that the astrogator is correct moresby reconnaissance will cover two areas captain how many spot checks can be made per hour just a moment captain sharpie interrupted has this discussion been directed at the ride i promised brigadier hirdjones im sorry maam wasnt that clear no i thought you were telling general moresby what you saw today isnt the brigadier available i want to settle the time with him moresby answered madam that has been changed im taking his place sharpie looked at moresby as if he were a side of beef she was about to condemn governor i do not recall offering this person a ride nor has the brigadier told me that he is not going moresby didnt you speak to hirdjones certainly i did sir i dislike to tell you
