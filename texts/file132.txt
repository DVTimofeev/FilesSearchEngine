so radioactive that we got out fast so were hitting ice more often than not five to four has no statistical significance zebadiah at least aunt hilda hasnt spotted even one black hat sharpie how good are your magic spectacles zebbie if i see them walk ill spot em no matter how theyre disguised in the simulations glinda and wizard cooked up i spotted their gait every time deety identified it by fourier analysis you feel confident thats enough zebbie i dont have clairvoyance there wasnt time to train me but glinda got me highly tuned to their awkward gait both with and without splints i want to discuss something else according to geologists when we were home earth where we were born i meanwe were in a brief warm period between glaciations if geologists are right i admitted if so well usually hit glaciation probably if yes if but we now know what glaciation looks like if you and jacob and deety can make it a drill we can flip past ice ages as fast as you spot one well speed it up jake zebadiah wait why deety were about to translate pop you told me to set for teh fiveplus jacob captain sharpie said thats right captain whats the trouble deety aunt hilda i said that fivetofour had little statistical significance but so far all glaciations have been in teh minus that could be chance but but doesn t look like it you want us to explore axis tehplus first astrogator no no captain auntie i would like to see enough of teh minus to have a significant sample at least a hundred jacob hilda if we check in one pseudodirection onlysay teh minusitll be four or five times as fast as hunting back and forth between plus and minus deety can set with one click zeb can yell execute as soon as you are satisfied jacob well get deety her sample but faster astrogator have our copilot set teh sixminus uh set captain when zebbie says go jacob you and deety flip them past as fast as you can without waiting for orders all well be looking for is ice ages we can spot one in a splitsecond if anyone sees a warm world yell stop deety can gay count them shes doing so captain we both are okay im going to give my magic specs a restwere looking for nothing but glaciers versus green worlds questions run out teh minus as fast as i can set and translate stop when anyone yells aye aye capn hillbilly honey sharpie nodded to me i snapped go stop yelped deety jacob ive never seen so much ice deety how many martinis would that make on the rocks or straight up never mind were out of vermouth did you get your sample yes captain one hundred ice ages no warm worlds im satisfied im not zebbie i want to extrapolate logarithmicallygo to teh minusonethousand then ten thousand a hundred thousand and so on jacob jake looked worried hilda my scales can be set for vernier setting five or one hundred thousand but that translation would take us more than twice around a superhyper great circlei think elucidate please i dont want to get lost my equations appear to be a description of sixdimensional space of positive curvature theyve workedso far but euclidean geometry and newtonian mechanics worked as long as our race didnt monkey with velocities approaching the speed of light then the approximations werent close enough i dont know that the plenum can be described with only six spacetime coordinates it might be more than sixpossibly far more mathematics can be used for prediction only after test against the real world jacob what is the real world ouch hilda i dont know but im afraid to get too many quanta away from our worldworldzero where we were born i think the extrapolation you propose would take us more than twice around a superhyper great circle to what world deety worldsixthousandsixhundredeightyeight on teh minus axis pop unless its skewed thanks deety captain if we arrived there we could return to earthzero by one setting if instead of a superhyper great circle we might follow a helix or some other curve through dimensions we know not of pop you took what i said and fancied it up rhip my dear you will appear as junior author on the monograph youll write and ill sign pop youre so good to me wouldnt smart girl return us simply by g a y h  m e those programs instruct a machine that has built into it only six dimensions perhaps she would but to our native universe so far from earthzero that we would be hopelessly lost if zeb and i were bachelors i would say lets go but we are family men deety set the next one teh fiveplus right zebadiah but captain auntie im game the long trip me too agreed captain sharpie i said in a tired voice those babies are ours as much as they are yours jake and i are taking no unnecessary risks captain sharpie if that doesnt suit you you can find another astrogator and another chief pilot mutiny deety shall we pull a lysistrata uhant we find some reasonable middle ground looks like a place to stop for lunch sharpie want to sniff for black hats take me down please about two thousand klicks above ground will you settle for five sissy pants yes if youll first have jacob zip us around night side to check for city lights give her what she wants jake by transiting an orbit takes too long give me operations way out on some lonely atoll for i am too young to diiiie i just want to grow old youre off key zebbie deety likes my singing anybody spot city lights we found no cities so jake put us down for lunch on a lonely atoll hilda first making certain
