to be on campus and my committee were not likely to go to the trouble of looking them up even if they were most of them werent at home in other languages even easy ones like french german and spanish but i did not waste time on phony field work i simply wanted a trip to europe at student air fares and the use of student hostelsdirt cheap way to travel and a visit to the trustees of grandpas fund
