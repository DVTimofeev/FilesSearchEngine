back at the dump make it fast say the word zeb said over his shoulder you girls stay in the car jake now we came bursting out like greyhounds guns at high port the reason for my disquiet was simple the dump of wrappings and cartons was no longer a heap something had spread it over many meters and the litter was not nearly enough to account for the pile wind zeb had left the wings extended the slightest wind would wake him warn him of change in weather the car had not rocked in the night ergo no wind ergo nocturnal visitors nor were they small i rounded the car to the left seeing nothing until i spotted zebwaved at him started back around to join him at the dump he arrived before i did i told you girls to stay in the car he was quite angry and the cause both of them were also at the dump my darling answered chief pilot zeb said huh sharpie theres no time for that theres something dangerous around you girls get inside before i pipe down one would not believe that so small a body could produce such a blast it caught zeb mouth open and jammed his words down his throat hilda did not give him opportunity to answer she continued forcefully chief pilot there are no girls here there are four adult humans one of them is my secondincommand and executive officer my executive officer i am in command hilda looked at my daughter astrogator did you tell anyone to remain in the car no captain deety was wearing her name rank and serial number face nor did i hilda looked at zeb there is no need to discuss it she stirred litter with a toe i had hoped that we could find salvage but three fourths of it has been eaten by large animals from those tooth marks i would have trouble visualizing a large animal that eats cellulose but is nevertheless carnivoroussave that i know one so we will get as much done as possible while keeping a tight guard i have the program planned but im open to advice hilda i let my tone get a bit sharp my wife looked around with features as impassive as those of my daughter copilot are you addressing me officially or socially uh as your husband i must put my foot down hilda you dont realize the situation well lift as soon as possibleand zeb will be in command the farce is over i hated to speak to my beloved that way but sometimes one must i braced myself for a blast none came hilda turned to zeb and said quietly chief pilot was my election a farce no captain astrogator did you think of it as farce me heavens no captain auntie hilda looked at me jacob from the balloting you voted for me at least once possibly three times were you joking i could not remember how i had felt when it dawned on me that zeb really did intend to resignpanic i think that i was about to be stuck with the job that was now irrelevant as i knew that i was not more than one micron from again being a bachelor so i resorted to higher truth no no my darlingmy darling captain i was dead serious did you find some malfeasance what no i i made a mistake jumped to conclusions i assumed that we would be leaving at oncend that zeb would command once we lifted after all its his car hilda gave me the briefest smile there is something to that last argument zebbie did you intend wait a half capn that car belongs to all of us just like jakes milky way bars we pooled resources so i have heard you all say since i had nothing to pool but a fur cape i took it with a grain of salt zebbie do you intend to resume command when we lift captain the only way you can quit is by resigning whereupon deety would be captain no sirree my daughter is notoften that shrill then jake would wind up holding the sack captain ill pilot when ordered chop wood and carry water between times but i didnt sign up to boss a madhouse i think youre finding out what i mean i think so too zebbie you thought there was an emergency and started giving orders i would not want that to happen in a real emergency it wont captain and i find to my chagrin that my husband considers me to be a play captain i think i must ask for a vote of confidence will you please find something to use as white and black balls captain auntie yes dear i am required to advise you a commanding officer commands she doesnt ask for votes you can resignordieor lose to a mutiny and get hanged from your own yardarm but if you take a vote youre not a captain youre a politician deetys right captain zeb told my wife had a caselaw case in rotc naval vessel department told the skipper to pick one of two ports for hoidays he let his crew vote on it word got back to washington and he was relieved at sea by his secondincommand and never again ordered to sea cos dont ask they tell em however if it matters to you im sorry i goofed and you do enjoy my confidence mine too and mine hilda my dear captain in truth i wanted zeb and only zeb to command when the car was off the ground but i made myself a solemn vow never again to say or do anything that might cause hilda to suspect it we would crash and die together rather than let her suspect that i thought her other than the ideal commanding officer hilda said the incident is closed who cant wait speak up i
