a busy thirty years you said you left home when you graduated from high school worked your way through college spent three years on active duty then worked your way through a doctors degree a phony one that doesnt reduce required residence aunt hilda says youve been a professor four years uh will you settle for nine years older than you are ill settle for whatever you say hes at it again put in sharpie he was run off two other campuses coed scandals then he found that in california nobody cared so he moved west i tried to look hurt sharpie darling i always married them one gal turned out already to be married and in the other case the child wasnt mine she slipped one over on me the truth isnt in him deety but hes brave and he bathes every day and hes richand we love him anyhow the truth isnt in you either aunt hilda but we love you anyhow it says in little women that a bride should be half her husbands age plus seven years zebadiah and i hit close to that a rule that makes an old hag out of me jacob im just zebbies age thirtyone but weve both been thirtyone for ages ill bet he does feel aged after carrying that thing uphill atlas can you support your burden while i get the garage open a bench dragged out and covered or shall i help you put it down id just have to pick it up again but dont dally xi citizens must protect themselves zeb i felt better after i got that rangers corpse dumped and the garage door closed everyone indoors i had told hilda that i felt no immediate danger but my wild talent does not warn me until the moment of truth the blokes in the black hats had us located or possibly had never lost us what applies to human gangsters has little to do with aliens whose powers and motives and plans we had no way to guess we might be as naive as a kitten who thinks he is hidden because his head is unaware that his little rump sticks out they were alien they were powerful they were multiple three thousand three millionwe didnt know the number of the beastand they knew where we were true we had killed oneby luck not by planning that ranger would be missed we could expect more to call in force foolhardiness has never appealed to me given a chance to run i run i dont mean ill bug out on wing mate when the unfriendlies show up and certainly not on a wife and unborn child but i wanted us all to runme my wife my blood brother who was also my fatherinlaw and his wife my chum sharpie who was brave practical smart and unsqueamish that she would joke in the jaws of moloch was not a fault but a source of esprit i wanted us to gotau axis teh axis rotate translate whateveranywhere not infested by gruesomes with green gore i checked the gauge and felt better gays inner pressure had not dropped oo much to expect gay to be a spaceshipnot equipped to scavenge and replenish air but it was pleasant to know that she would hold pressure much longer than it would take us to scram for home if we had toassuming that unfriendlies had not shot holes in her graceful shell i went by the inside passageway into the cabin used soap and hot water rinsed off and did it again dried down and felt clean enough to kiss my wife which i did deety held onto me and reported your kit is packed sir im finishing mine the planned weight and space and nothing but practical clothes sweetheart yes zebadiah take the clothes you were married in and mine too same for jake and hilda and your fathers dress uniform or was it burned in logan but zebadiah you emphasized rugged clothes so i did to keep your mind on the fact that we cant guess the conditions well encounter and dont know how long well be gone or if well be back so i listed everything that might be useful in pioneering a virgin planetsince we might be stranded and never get home everything from jakes microscope and watertesting gear to technical manuals and tools and weaponsand flea powder but its possible that we will have to play the roles of ambassadors for humanity at the court of his extreme majesty overlord of galactic empires in thousandthandthird continuum we may need the gaudiest clothes we can whip up we dont know we cant guess id rather pioneer we may not have a choice when you were figuring weights do you recall spaces marked assigned mass such and suchlist to come certainly total exactly one hundred kilos which seemed odd space slightly less than one cubic meter split into crannies those are yours snubnose and pop or hilda mass can be up to fifty percent over ill tell gay to trim to match got an old doll a security blanket a favorite book of poems scrapbook family photographs bring em all golly i never enjoy looking at my wife quite so much as when she lights up and is suddenly a little girl dont leave space for me i have only what i arrived with what about shoes for hilda she claims she doesnt need any zebadiahthat her calluses are getting calluses on them but ive worked out expedients i got pop some dr scholls shoe liners when we were building i have three pairs left and can trim them liners and enough bobby sox make her size threeandhalf feet fit my clodhoppers pretty well and i have a sentimental keepsake keds pop bought me when i first went to summer camp at ten they fit aunt hilda good girl i added you seem to have everything in hand how
