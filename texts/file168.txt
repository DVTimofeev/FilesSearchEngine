dora announced tomorrows songi thought that was what she said lazarus and maureen held hands all through it and it was not a song that would fit the title i thought i had heard i got straightened out when the song ended to dead silence and maureen said to lazarus theodcrre ishtar was going to rearrange the watch list but tamara vetoed it she did it for you dear man and for mebut tamara is anxious to see you tamara always knows what shes doing lazarus answered yes tammy always knows what is best agreed mama maureen tell me theodore do i still make you think of her lazarus looked upset uh i dont know you dont look like herut you feel like her and you look more like nancy than you look like yourself yes i know none of our family was willing to wait youve been away from home too long be patient and when i look like me to your eyes tell us and galahad will hold my cosmetic age at that are you going to do as you promised me so long ago take tammy and me to bed together perhaps i should add theodore i am now wife to your cohusbands i dont ask that you marry me although i think tammy will be shocked if you dont but i shant make it difficult either way i will hold to any pretence you wish i did for brian i shall for you maureen was neither shouting nor whispering she was simply bringing him up to date on things he needed to know lazarus started to answer his expression oddly mixed when elizabeth cut in lazarus eh what lib message to you from ishtar to be delivered when needed and now is the time ish read both your charts with her computer set for maximum pessimism she also had them read at new rome without identification other than her own file numbers she has this message for youn answer to the answer you will make she says to tell you that you are an uncivilized primitive ignorant of science especially genetics oversentimental almost pathologically stubborn retarded probably senile superstitious and provincialnd that she loves you dearly but will not permit you to make decisions in her area of authority in vitro or in utero the cross will take place let me add that maureen was not given a choice either so you can tell the bigarsed bitch that i agree with every word she says especially the part about senile and that i gave up all hope of arguing with her tyrannical ways fifty years ago and that i love her just as dearlyoutside her clinicand that maureen will tell her how such things will be handled i dont have a vote he turned toward me looking past sharpies pretty toes zeb here is the wisdom of the ages men rule but women decide elizabeth do you think i am anything like tamara mmm never thought about it yes you both have that allmother feeling uh would you mind taking off costume it distracts me from looking at you no trouble elizabeth i dont like round garters except as advertising mama maureen kicked off her shoes took off the garters carefully rolled down her hose in a manner interuniversalstood up and stood easily not posing turn around slowly mmm maureen you do look like tammy or vice versa its probably your genes in her am i descended from you does anyone here know lazarus you are lib but not through me through my sister carol santa carolita believe it or notwhich would surprise carol as she was no saint but your descent through carol was not proved until long after you were killed when the families records were being revised through computer analysis and a deeper knowledge of genes no saints in our family are there mama none that i know of woodrow not me certainly you were a little hellion i should have spanked you much oftener than i did mmm your father was as close to being a saint as any in our family brian was wise and goodand tolerant she smiled do you recall why we separated im not sure i ever knew mama my recollections of that era are much sharper for my trip there as ted bronsonthe other is a long time back in my sixties i stopped having babies about the same time your brother richard was killed war his wife marian justin of the hardy family was with us with their children and brian was back in uniform a recalled colonel on a desk job in san francisco when richard was killed in  we all took it hard but it was easier in that so many of us were togetherbrian and my youngest children and marian and her childrenfive she was thirtyone mama maureen free of stockings and shoes sat in lotus across from hilda and accepted a plate from doras helpers woodrow i encouraged brian to console marian the only way a widow can be helped she needed it when that war was over marian needed a visible husband her waistband and the calendar could not be reconciled when we moved from san francisco later that year it was easy for marian justin smith to become maureen j smith while i became with the aid of hair dye her widowed motherno one knew us in amarillo and females were not yet compelled to have ids so marian had the baby as maureen and only with the howard families trustees was the correct genealogy recorded maureen smiled we howards were easy about such things as long as it was kept inside the familiesand i am happy that we are even easfer about it now on our next move i moved out and became maureen johnson again fifteen years younger since i did not look late seventies and a meenahsotah yonson woodrow rather than a southern missouri johnson a
