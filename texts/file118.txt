me have it i wrote zebadiah on my fresh ballot placed it face up on the chief pilots seat placed the other three one by one on top of it then declared them myself deetydeetydeetythen in my own handwriting deety i gave up but resolved to have a word with the wizard it was a pretty cottage with a broad stoop and a climbing rosebut not to live in just one room with a table and no other furniture the table held a bowl of fruit a pitcher of milk four tumblers there was a door to the right and a door to the left the one on the left had painted on it a little girl in a sunbonnet the other had a boy in a buster brown suit hilda and i headed for the sunbonnet i snatched a glass of milk and a bunch of grapes and put on a milk moustache i hadnt tasted milk in ages delicious hilda was drawing a tub and had peeled off her dress the window was open but up high so i peeled off mine we made ourselves clean and beautiful ie we restored our fanciest hairdos but without jewelry whatever we needed that bath and dressing room had from a sponge to lipstick aunt hildas shade we hurried and did it in fortytwo minutes zebadiah looked beautiful and pop looked just as smart in dark trousers and a richly simple aloha shirt we thought you said my husband had gone down the drain zebadiah we took fortytwo minutes if you did it in less than thirty you arent clean smell me i sniffed hima faint fragrance of soap a touch of shaving lotion you took more than thirty minutes kiss me thirtysix minutes by my watch say please i said please and he caught me with my lips open he always does zebadiah just suits me and i havent been sulky with him and stubborn only when necessary there was a path toward the palace pop with aunt hilda on his arm led off we followed aunt hilda was carrying her highheeled sandals so i took mine off and glanced back toward the clearing the little cottage was missing as i expected zebadiah noticed it but said nothing his face was an interesting study the grassy path debouched into a garden in front of the palace the path through it was hard so hilda and i put on our shoes glindas palace was more like a norman chateau or berties stately home of england than it was like those dreary castles on the rhinebut it had fairyland grace like the taj as we started up the sweeping marble steps to the great doorway zebadiah stumbled what the hell sssh i said language dear a magic staircase glinda would not make her guests climb pretend that escher designed it look proud and walk as if they were level as we reached the broad landing two tall trumpeters stepped out of the great doorway raised their long trumpets and sounded four flourishes an old man with a merry grin a fringe of whiskers a shiny bald head a wooden left leg and wearing a sailors oilskins came out as the flourishes ended i wondered why he was here rather than emerald city he took a pipe from his mouth and said welcome to the palace of glinda the good im capn bill you sir are

betsy aint happy unless shes workin neptune knows that mule gets more attention than all the mules that ever came out of mizzoura this way to the library friends how does one describe glinda the good everyone knows that she is tall and stately and beautiful and never frowns and wears all day long what i think of as beautiful evening gowns with sweeping trains but those are just words perhaps it is enough to say that just as dejah thoris is the most beautiful woman of her world the sorceress is the most beautiful of hers she was surrounded by her bevy of the most beautiful girls from all over oz but glinda outshone
