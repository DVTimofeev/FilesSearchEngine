yes yes shes been listeningshes crying tooand i would be but im captain and cant the smudged faces changed lib long speaking commodore libby captain lorelei has told me something not only hard to believe but if she is cloned from her brother as i have read she may have his talent for lying from what i know of you i dont think you ever learned how to lie commodore it is true that i never learned to lie convincingly so i gave it up a long time ago very well lib is lazarus long in fact confined and under arrest yes to both his door wont open and dora has been instructed not to let him out until you permit it whats this about saving her mothers life if they are clones from a man the age lazarus is alleged to be their mother must have died a couple of millennia back its as complex as my case commodore but quite different the twins have hostmothers but lor was speaking of the genetic mother of herself her twin sister and lazarus long she was reported dead more than two thousand oldhometerra years ago but there is some hope that the records were confused and that it may be possible to save her it cant be done without your help and the help of the gay deceiver i dont think the chances are good even so but without your helpwell i would have to try to devise such a drive as gay is reported to haveand i dont think i can wait a moment libby gay cut transmission from cabin keep circuit ready can you find your way unassisted back into your berth in dora did you get it into your perms i did i thought i might want to find dora someday are you displeased with me i know it wasnt authorized but i didnt threetimes it i can wipe it gay deceiver new program new parking spot code word dora long i tell you three times hilda i hear you three times gay deceiver dora long execute the stars went away and lighted alcoves were at our doors xlii youre a figment of imagination zeb hear that laz youre a figment of imagination no lor you are a figment im a fig what she said was fica and deety suppressed a giggle i pinched her and told her in family tap code that she had a dirty mindwhich she ignored being proud of it rather than otherwise it was a long time later that i learned that laz had used a galacta wordbut the ancient pun still applied jake reiterated patiently lazlor the key point of commodore hildas theory is that we are all equally figments of imagination reality thus becomes a null sythbol deety shook her head emphatically stick to geometry pop or stamp collecting leave symbology to symbologistssuch as your favorite daughter im real i am smell me no doubt you could use a bath so could we all its been an adrenaline day but thats the other side of the coin deety imaginary and real turn out to be identical consider this chow bench on one level of abstraction it is mathematical equations at the level just below that it is a swirling nothlngness with massenergy a rare event but on the gross level abstracted by my senses i can place this drink on it with utter confidence that it will not sink through this near vacuum my fatherinlaw matched his words by placing his highball on the snack bench it sank out of sight jake looked tired not my day dora did you do that yes and no professor what kind of answer is that you placed it on a takeaway spot and that part of me was on automatic and took it away and sterilized it im sorry sir and heres your fresh drink it was indeed a busy day no one had been waiting at our parking berth but three young women arrived at a dead run while sharpie was swapping seats with deetyour brandnew commodore planned to be first to step into her new ship the starboard door opened sharpie stepped out a dignified procession of one and was hit from three sides by three young women each managing to laugh and cry at the same time but sharpie enjoys everything and her aplomb has never been shaken she kissed them let them kiss her petted them and told them to calm down everything was all right dears i never intended to stay away i simply refused to let the great lazarus long put one over on sharpie where is he now shut up in the flag cabin maam commodore captain lor lock him up elsewhere the flag cabin is mine aye aye commodore how long will that take seconds i mean not hours lor spoke rapidly to dora in a language i almost understood i leaned to my right spoke to my wife spanish some sort italian deety answered will you settle for latino noi remember now galacta well have to learn it but it sounds easy lor reported flag cabin will be ready for you by the time you reach it commodore very good i expect to use it primarily as an administration office flag remains in gay deceiver that is appropriate since dora is unarmed whereas gay deceiver is an attack ship an armed privateerheavily armed for her size sharpie smiled a few days ago in another universe we destroyed an entire air army we dont have fancies such as artificial gravity we belt down and fight in free fall gay deceiver is stripped for speed and armament dora is just the opposite the two complement each other beautifully i wondered why sharpie was blatheringbut she always has reasons i think she reads minds im certain that lazlor do with each other they looked at each other then the flag of an armed privateer is the skullandcrossbones is
