with her forearm zebbie you wouldnt believe it try me well look at this she touched the corpses right leg and spoke to the corpse itself whats a nice joint like this doing in a girl like you i saw what she meant a long gaunt leg with an extra knee lower than the human knee it bent backwards looking higher i saw that its arms had similar extra articulation did you say girl i said girl zebbie this monster is either female or hermaphroditic a fully developed uterus twohorned like a cat one ovary above each horn but there appear to be testes lower down and a dingus that may e a retractable phallus femalebut probably male as well bisexual but does not impregnate itself the plumbing wouldnt hook up i think these critters can both pitch and catch taking turns or simultaneously wouldnt that be sumpn no for mechanical reasons i think they take turns whether ten minutes apart or ten years deponent sayeth not but id give a pretty to see two of em going to it sharpie youve got a onetrack mind its the main track reproduction is the main track the methods and mores of sexual copulation are the central feature of all higher developments of life youre ignoring money and television piffle all human activities including scientific research are either mating dances and care of the young or the dismal sublimations of born losers in the only game in town dont try to kid sharpie took me fortytwo years to grab a real man and get myself knocked upbut i made it everything ive done up to the last two weeks has been vamp till ready how about you you shameless stud am i not right careful how you answer ill tell deety ill take the fifth make mine a quart zebbie i hate these monsters they interfere with my plansa rosecovered cottage a baby in the crib a pot roast in the oven me in a gingham dress and my man coming down the lane after a hard day flunking freshmenme with his slippers and his pipe and a dry martini waiting for him heaven all else is vanity and vexation four fully developed mammary glands but lacking the redundant fat characteristic of the human femalecept me damn it a double stomach a single intestine a twocompartment heart that seems to pump by peristalsis rather than by beating cordate i havent examined the brain i dont have a proper sawbut it must be as well developed as ours definitely humanoid outrageously nonhuman dont knock over those bottles they are specimens of body fluids what are these things splints to conceal the unhuman articulation plastic surgery on the face too im pretty sure and cheaters to reshape the skull the hair is fake these boojums dont have hair somethinglike tattooingor maybe masking i havent been able to peel offto make the face and other exposed skin look human instead of bluegreen zeb seventotwo a large number of missing persons have been used as guinea pigs before they worked out methods for this masquerade swoop a flying saucer dips down and two more guinea pigs wind up in their laboratories there hasnt been a flying saucer scare in years poetic license dear if they have spacetime twisters they can pop up anywhere steal what they wantor replace a real human with a convincing fakeand be gone like switching off a light this one couldnt get by very long rangers have to take physical examinations this one may be a rush job prepared just for us a permanent substitution might fool anything but an xrayand might fool even xray if the doctor giving the examination was one of them a theory you might think about zebbie i must get to work there is so much to learn and so little time i cant learn a fraction of what this carcass could tell a real comparative biologist can i help i was not anxious to well i havent much to do until jake and deety finish assembling the last of what they are going to take so what can i do to help i could work twice as fast if you would take pictures i have to stop to wipe my hands before i touch the camera im your boy sharpie just say what angle distance and when hilda looked relieved zebbie have i told you that i love you despite your gorilla appearance and idiot grin underneath you have the soul of a cherub i want a bath so badly i can taste itcould be the last hot bath in a long time and the bidetthe acme of civilized decadence ive been afraid i would still be carving strange meat when jacob said it was time to leave carve away dear youll get your bath i picked up the camera the one jake used for recordkeeping a polaroid stereoinstamaticselffocusing automatic irising automatic processing the perfect camera for engineer or scientist who needs a running record i took endless pictures while hilda sweated away sharpie doesnt it worry you to work with bare hands you might catch the nevergetovers zebbie if these critters could be killed by our bugs they would have arrived here with no immunities and died quickly they didnt therefore it seems likely that we cant by hurt by their bugs radically different biochemistries it sounded logicalbut i could not forget ketterings law logic is an organized way of going wrong with confidence deety appeared set down a loaded hamper thats the last she had her hair up in a bath knot and was dressed solely in rubber gloves hi dearest aunt hilda im ready to help not much you can do deety honunless you want to relieve zebbie deety was staring at the corpse and did not look happyher nipples were down flat go take a bath i told her scram do i stink that badly you stink swell honey girl but sharpie
