cuddlykissed me and put us down there is no one more cuddly than jacob hilda youre prejudiced lets each mix our own drinks at the strength required for our emotional and physical conditions so we didit wound up with hilda and me each taking a jigger with soda pop taking a jigger and a half over iceand zebadiah taking a half jigger of vodka and drowning it with coke while we were sipping our medicine zebadiah sprawled out looked up over the fireplace pop you were in the navy noarmy if you count chairborne infantry they handed me a commission for having a doctorate in mathematics told me

for captain john carter my apologies dejah thoris i accept and will keep it bright i will defend my princess with it against all enemies helium is proud to accept if you make a cradle of your hands i can stand in them and reach it down zebadiah grasped me a hand above each knee and i was suddenly three meters tall sword and belt were on hooks i lifted them down and myself was placed down my husband stood straight while i buckled it around himthen he dropped to one knee and kissed my hand my husband is mad northnorthwest but his madness suits me i got tears in my eyes which deety doesnt do much but dejah thoris seems prone to since john carter made her his pop and aunt hilda watchedthen imitated including i saw tears in hildas eyes after she buckled on pops saber when he knelt and kissed her hand zebadiah drew sword tried its balance sighted along its blade handmade and balanced close to the hilt deety your greatgrandfather paid a pretty penny for this its an honest weapon i dont think he knew what it cost it was presented to him for good reason i feel certain zebadiah stood back went into hanging guard made fast moulinets vertically left and right then horizontally clockwise and counterclockwisesuddenly dropped into swordsmans guard lunged and recovered fast as a striking cat i said softly to pop did you notice pop answered quietly know saber sword too hilda

grinned and sat down still wearing sword no another school  mit inquired pop hardly pop this should stay in the family i undertook to prove that a man can get a doctorate from a major university without knowing anything and without adding anything whatever to human knowledge  think you have a degree in aerospace engineering pop said flatly ill concede that i have the requisite hours i hold two degreesa bacca laureate in humane arts meaning i squeaked through and a doctorate from an old and prestigious schoola phd in education zebadiah you wouldnt i was horrified but i did deety to prove that degrees per se are worthless often they are honorifics of true scientists or learned scholars or inspired teachers much more frequently they are false faces for overeducated jackasses pop said youll get no argument from me zeb a doctorate is a union card to get a tenured job it does not mean that the holder thereof is wise or learned yes sir i was taught it at my grandfathers kneemy grandfather zachariah the man responsible for the initial z in the names of his male descendants deety his influence on me was so strong that i must explain him no thats impossible i must tell about
