first round the party never gets smaller this round is yours wheres that misbegotten waiter here madam the same all around and dont call me madam jubal your usual lafe i know what the gentlemen take thank you madam the waiter disappeared uppity hazel made a fast draw should have made him dance she twirled and reholstered hilda where have i seen that sneaky face before jacob and i were discussing that he reminds me of a fake forest ranger but that was in a far country and besides the beast is dead could be a family resemblance but hillbilly i mean today got it the ticket taker identical twins maybe hazel went on other identical twins are my first two reasons lazarus my grandsons i wont shoot holes in your mirrors or carve my initials in tamaras furniture but i make no guarantees about cas and pol in a hilton they put the damage on the tab i pay it and make my grandsons wish they had never been born but you would not let me pay and were going to be here quite a piece my daughterinlaw doctor edith has decided that she needs a couple of years under doctor ishtar has anyone seen a pair of twin boysmansize but boysredheadednot the color of mine mines out of a bottlethe color mine used to be hazel here twins and red hair are as common as magicians in atlantis gilgamesh must have stayed overnight i saw them talking to caleb catlum said maureen well he should be a match for thembut dont bet on it lazarus is atlantis represented from thirteen universes they are having a jurisdictional dispute suits meif any get sore and leave they wont get a refund your grandsons may have been with caleb but i know whereno with whomi know with whom they are now put in professor burroughs laz and lor oho hazel ill tell athene to settle your bill and move your luggage we have an antidote for cas and pol optimist deal em waiter and give him the chit what antidote the waiter started to hand the check to lazarus before he looked at himstopped abruptly and left still with the tab would cas and pol be interested in becoming pirates lazarus they are pirates i was hoping they would tone down as they grew up but now theyre eighteen terran reckoning and each one is two yards of deceit and chicanery the jd after my name means that i studied law at a school that handed out that degree in place of llbbut my rapscallions are jds too but not lawyers well space lawyers hazel you won your first jd long before you studied law no the accused stood mute and the court ordered a plea of nux vomica entered in the record my twins are more than twice as old as your boys but it doesnt show they look a year or two younger and they are permanent juvenile delinquents they want to take a fling at piracy which i deplore having sampled the trade your boysdo they respect good machinery can they take care of it make nonshipyard repairs lazarus they can repair anything that ticks or doesnt tick worried me a mite as they were a little slow in noticing girls but they outgrew that symptom without outgrowing machinery you might tell them that my clonesisters own a spaceship faster and more powerful than any of your home period and analog one that could be outfitted as a privateer it might result in all four dying happily but i do not interfere in other peoples lives hilda put her palms together closed her eyes and said dear lord do not strike him dead he didnt mean it yours truly hilda burroughs long lazarus ignored her nor do i lazarus other than occasionally with a horse whip forgot to mention they arent gelded hazel lazlor are vaccinated and would have to come back here to see ishtar to get it reversed as for rasslin matches any male who tried to rape one of my clones would be gelded informally at once no instruments no anesthesia i trained em myself forget it apparently theyve already met theyll settle their own affairs if any their own way leave cas and pol in that hilton if you wishby the way i own itbut youre coming home or ill tell tamara bully i dont bully worth a hoot lazarus im out of it tamara never bullies she merely gets her own way what was this third reason well dont tell on me ishtar is a fine girl but i have no wish to stay where she could corner me and try to sell me rejuvenation lazarus looked horrified who has been feeding you nonsense well its a commercial enterprise is it not certainly
