that lazarus was bellyaching that no work would get done because half of them would be shocked half would be drooling and half would be both shocked and drooling so tamara hired this paskoodnyahk to supply the seewhatyouexpect illusion with the contract limited to delegates in danger of emotional shock did my sisters appearance shock you of course not admitted i come from one of those sick culturesand did not know that i was sick until i got well but i underwent experiences that would cure anyone of such emotional disturbance when i find myself a stranger in a strange land i savor the
