it aside like a stripper whats for breakfast asked pooh i misquoted i was not answered deety made me proud of her for the nth time for years she had consulted me at least with her eyes on policy decisions now she looked not at me but at her husband zeb was doing old stone face refusing assent or dissent deety stared at him gave a tiny shrug reached behind her and untied or unsnapped something and discarded her own top i said whats for breakfast i repeated greedy gut my daughter answered you men have had baths while aunt hilda and i havent had a chance to get clean for fear of waking you slugabeds is that what it is i thought a skunk had wandered past whats for breakfast aunt hilda in only hours pop has lost all the training ive given him for five years pop its laid out and ready to go how about cooking while hilda and i grab a tub zeb stood up ill cook deety ive been getting my own breakfast for years hold it buster my bride interrupted sit down zebbie deety never encourage a man to cook breakfast it causes him to wonder if women are necessary if you always get his breakfast and dont raise controversial issues until after his second cup of coffee you can get away with murder the rest of the time they dont notice other odors when they smell bacon im going to have to coach you my daughter reversed the field fast she turned to her husband and said meekly what does my captain wish for breakfast my princess whatever your lovely hands offer me what we were offered as fast as deety could pour batter and hilda could serve was a gourmet specialty that would enrage a cordon bleu but which for my taste is ambrosia a oneeyed texas stacka tall stack of thin tender buttermilk pancakes to janes recipe supporting one large egg up and easy surrounded by hot sausage and the edifice drowned in melting butter and hot maple syrup with a big glass of orange juice and a big mug of coffee on the side zeb ate two stacks i concluded that my daughter would have a happy marriage vi are men and women one race hilda deety and i washed dishes then soaked in her tub and talked about husbands we giggled and talked with the frankness of women who trust each other and are sure that no men can overhear do men talk that openly in parallel circumstances from all i have been able to learn in aftermidnight horizontal conversations all passion spent men do not or not men i would take to bed whereas a perfect lady which jane was deety is and i can simulate will talk with another perfect lady she trusts in a way that would cause her father husband or son to faint i had better leave out our conversation this memoir might fall into the hands of one of the weaker sex and i would not want his death on my conscience are men and women one race i know what biologists saybut history is loaded with scientists jumping to conclusions from superficial evidence it seems to me far more likely that they are symbiotes i am not speaking from ignorance i was one trimester short of a bs in biology and a straighta student when a biology experiment blew up in my face and caused me to leave school abruptly not that i need that degree ive papered my private bath with

rarely uses but i carry my own perfume in my purse and used it in the twentytwo classic places deety uses only the basic aphrodisiac soap and water perfume on her would be gilding the lily fresh out

offered me a dress and i told her not to be silly any dress of hers would fit me like a tent you put something bridal and frilly around your hips and lend me your boldest gstring job dear i surprised you when i jockeyed you into taking off your halter after telling you that you were wise not to rush it but the chance showed up and i grabbed the ring on the fly weve got our men gentled to nearly
