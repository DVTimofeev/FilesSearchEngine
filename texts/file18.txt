my princess i will not spank a pregnant woman but i can think about it pop snug harbor continues to impress me did you use an architect hrrumph architect is a dirty word i studied engineering architects copy each others mistakes and call it art even frank lloyd wright never understood what the gilbreths were doing his houses looked great from the outsideinside they were hideously inefficient dust collectors gloomy psych lab rat mazes pfui how about neutra if he hadnt been hamstrung by building codes and union rules and zoning laws neutra could have been great but people dont want efficient machines for living they prefer to crouch in medieval hovels as their fleabitten forebears did cold drafty unsanitary poor lighting and no need for any of it i respect your opinion sir popthree fireplaceso chimneys how why zeb i like fireplacesand a few cords of wood can save your life in the mountains but i see no reason to warm the outdoors or to call attention to the fact that we are in residence or to place trust in spark arresters in forestfire country lighting a fire in a fireplace here automatically starts its exhaust fan smoke and particles are electrostatically precipitated the precipitators are autoscrubbed when stack temperature passes twentyfive celsius dropping hot air goes through labyrinths under bathtubs and floors then under other floors thence into a rock heatsink under the garage a sink that drives the heat pump that serves the house when flue gas finally escapes at points distant from the house it is so close to ambient temperature that only the most sensitive heatseeker could sniff it thermal efficiency plus the security of being inconspicuous but suppose you are snowed in so long that your power packs play out franklin stoves in storage stove pipe to match stops in the walls removable from inside to receive thimbles for flue pipes pop i inquired is this covered by rule one or was rule one abolished last night in elko eh the chair

like i know an item about no braindoctor neil brain zebadiah offered give i got this from a reliable source but cant prove it irrelevant as long as its juicy go ahead zebbie well a certain zaftig coed told this on herself she tried to give her all to brainy in exchange for a passing grade in the general math course necessary to any degree on our campus it is rigged to permit prominent but stupid athletes to graduate miss zaftig was flunking it which takes exceptional talent so she arranged an appointment with the department headbrainy and made her quidproquo clear he could give her horizontal tutoring then and there or in her apartment or his apartment or in a motel and she would pay for it or whenever and wherever he chose but she had to pass happens on every campus son pop told him i havent reached the point she blabbed the storynot angry but puzzled she says that she was unable to get her intention over to him which seems impossible ive seen this young woman brainy didnt accept didnt refuse wasnt offended didnt seem to understand he told her that she had better talk to her instructor about getting tutoring and a reexam now miss zaftig is circulating the story that prof no brain must be a eunuch or a robot not even a homo totally sexless hes undoubtedly stupid aunt hilda commented but ive never met a man i couldnt get that point across to if i tried even if he was uninterested in my fair virginal carcass ive never tried with professor brain because im not interested in his carcass even barbecued then hilda my darling why did you invite him to your party what because of your note jacob i dont refuse you favors but hilda i dont understand when i talked to you by telephone i asked you to invite zebunder the impression that he was his cousin zebulonand i did say that two or three others from the department of mathematics might make it less conspicuously an arranged meeting but i didnt mention doctor brain and i did not write jacobi have your note in california on your university stationery with your name printed on it professor burroughs shook his head looked sad zebadiah carter said sharpiehandwritten or typed typed but it was signed wait a moment let me think it has my name and address down in the lower left jacobs name was typed too but
