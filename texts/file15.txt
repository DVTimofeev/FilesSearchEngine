bangyoure dead my thumb is the axis my forefinger represents the push the other fingers show the rotation go to the head of the class nowthink hardsuppose we put a gyroscope in a frame then impress equal forces at all three spatial coordinates at once what would it do i tried to visualize it i think it would either faint or drop dead a good first hypothesis according to jake it disappears they do disappear aunt hilda i watched it happen several times but where do they go i cant follow jakes math i have to accept his transformations without proof but it is based on the notion of six spacetime coordinates three of space the usual three that we seemarked x y and zand three time coordinates one marked t like this t and one marked tau greek alphabet i and the third from the cyrillic alphabet teh rn looks like an m with a macron over it so it does but its what the russians use for t no the russians use chai for tea in thick glasses with strawberry jam stow it sharpie so we have x y and z t tau and teh six dimensions it is basic to the theory that all are at right angles to each other and that any one may be swapped for any of the others by rotationor that a new coordinate may be found not a seventh but replacing any of the six by translationsay tau to tau prime by displacement along x zebbie i think i fell off about four coordinates back my husband suggested show her the caltrop zeb good idea zeb accepted a widget from my husband placed it in front of me it looked like jacks i used to play with as a little girl but not enough things sticking outfour instead of six three touched the table a tripod the fourth stuck straight up zeb said this is a weapon invented centuries ago the points should be sharp but these have been filed down he flipped it let it fall to the table no matter how it falls one prong is vertical scatter them in front of cavalry the horses go downdiscouraging they came into use again in wars one and two against anything with pneumatic tiresbicycles motorcycles lorries and so forth big enough they disable tanks and tracked vehicles a small sort can be whittled from thorn bushes for guerrilla warfareusually poisoned and quite nasty but here this lethal toy is a geometrical projection a drawing of the coordinates of a fourdimensional spacetime continuum each spike is exactly ninety degrees from every other spike fliit h   i     mrn fhiy  ricjt itcrlt  i said it was a projection sharpie its an isometric projection of fourdimensional coordinates in threedimensional space that distorts the anglesnd the human eye is even more limited cover one eye and hold still and you see only two dimensions the illusion of depth is a construct of the brain im not very good at holding still no she isnt agreed my bridegroom whom i love dearly and at that instant could have choked but i can close both eyes and feel three dimensions with my hands a good point close your eyes and pick this up and think of the prongs as the four directions of a fourdimensional space does the word tesseract mean anything to you my high school geometry teacher showed us how to construct themprojectionswith modeling wax and toothpicks fun i found other fourdimensional figures that were easy to project and a number of ways to project them sharpie you must have had an exceptional geometry teacher in an exceptional geometry class dont faint zebbie but i was grouped with what they called overachievers after it became undemocratic to call them gifted children be durned why do you always behave like a fritterhead why dont you ever look beneath the surface young man i laugh because i dare not cry this is a crazy world and the only way to enjoy it is to treat it as a joke that doesnt mean i dont read and cant think i read everything from giblett to hoyle from sartre to pauling i read in the tub i read on the john i read in bed i read when i eat alone and i would read in my sleep if i could keep my eyes open deety this is proof that zebbie has never been in my bed the books downstairs are display the stuff i read is stacked in my bedroom deety did you think i had been sleeping with sharpie no zebadiah and you never will deety told me what a sex maniac you are you lay your lecherous hands on me and ill scream for jacob and hell beat you to a pulp dont count on it dear one my husband said mildly zeb is bigger and younger and stronger than i and if i found it needful to try deety would cry and beat me to a pulp son i should have warned you my daughter is vicious at karate the killer instinct thanks forewarned forearmed ill use a kitchen chair in one hand a revolver in the second and a whip in the other just as i used to do in handling the big cats for ringling barnum and bailey thats three hands said deety im fourdimensional darling professor we can speed up this seminar weve been underrating our overachiever hilda is a brain zebbie can we kiss and make up class is in session zebadiah there is always time for that right pop ki hcv smi nr qhpll sulk  i dont sulk i bite i think youre cute too zebbie answered grabbed me by both shoulders dragged me over the table and kissed me hard our teeth grated and my nipples went spung sometimes i wish i werent so noble he dropped me abruptly and said
