creatures are not human eh zeb your reasoning escapes me deety run it through the computer the one between your ears i did not answer i just sat and thought after several minutes of unpleasant thoughts i said zebadiah the black hats dont know about the apparatus in our basement conclusive assumption my husband agreed because we are still alive they are determined to destroy a new work in mathematics and to kill the brain that produced it a probability approaching unity zebadiah again agreed because it can be used to travel among the universes conclusive corollary my husband noted for this purpose human beings fall into three groups those not interested in mathematics more complex than that needed to handle money those who know a bit about other mathematics and a quite small third group who could understand the possibilities yes but our race does not know anything of other universes so far as i know they dont necessary assumption but that third group would not try to stop an attempt to travel among the universes they would wait with intellectual interest to see how it turned out they might believe or disbelieve or suspend judgment but they would not oppose they would be delighted if my father succeeded the joy of intellectual discoverythe mark of a true scientist i sighed and added i see no other grouping save for a few sick people psychotic these three subsets complete the set our opponents are not psychotic they are intelligent crafty and organized as we all know too well zebadiah echoed therefore our opponents are not human beings they are alien intelligences from elsewhere i sighed again and shut up being an oracle is a nogood profession or elsewhen sharpie can you kill kill whom zebbie or what can you kill to protect jake you bet your frimpin life ill kill to protect jacob i wont ask you princess i know dejah thoris zebadiah went on thats the situation ladies we have the most valuable man on this planet to protect we dont know from what jake your bodyguard musters two amazons one small one medium large both probably knocked up and one cowardly lion id hire the dorsai if i knew their po box or the gray lensman and all his pals but we are all there are and well try avete alieni nos morituri vos spernimus lets break out that champagne my captain do you think we should i asked im frightened we should im no good for more work today and neither is jake tomorrow well start installing the gadget in gay deceiver do rewiring and reprogramming so that she will work for any of us meanwhile we need a couple of laughs and a nights sleep what better time to drink life to the dregs than when we know that any hour may be our last aunt hilda punched zebadiah in the ribs yer dern tootin buster im going to get giggle happy and make a fool of myself and then take my man and put him to sleep with old mother sharpies timetested nostrum deety i prescribe the same for you i suddenly felt better check aunt hilda captain john carter always wins cowardly lion my foot who is pop the little wizard i think he is could be pop will you open the bubbly i always hurt my thumbs right away deety i mean dejah thoris royal consort of the warlord no need to be formal pop this is going to be an informal party very pop do i have to keep my pants on ask your husband youre his problem now viii let us all preserve our iilusion hilda in my old age sucking my gums in front of the fire and iving over my misdeeds ill remember the next few days as the happiest in my life id had three honeymoons earlier one with each of my termcontract husbands two had been good one had been okay and eventually very lucrative but my honeymoon with jacob was heavenly the whiff of danger sharpened the joy jacob seemed unworried and zebbie has hunches like a horseplayer seeing that zebbie was relaxed deety got over being jumpyand i never was as i hope to end like a firecracker not linger on ugly helpless useless a spice of danger adds zest to life even during a honeymoonespecially during a honeymoon an odd honeymoon we worked hard but our husbands seemed never too busy for pat fanny squeeze tittv and unhurried kisses not a group marriage but two twosomes that were one family comfortable each with the others i dropped most of my own sparkvbitch ways and zebbie sometimes called me hilda rather than sharpie jacob and i moved into marriage like ham and eggs jacob is not tall  centimeters but tall compared with my scant one fiftvtwo and his hairline recedes and he has a paunch from years at a deskhut he looks just right to me if i wanted to look at male beauty i could always look at deetys giant appreciate him without lusting my own loving goat kept sharpie quite blunted i did not decide when zebbie came on campus to make a pet of him for his looks but for his veering sense of humor but if there was ever a man who could have played the role of john carter warlord of mars it was zebadiah carter whose middle name just happens to be john indoors with clothes and wearing his fake hornrims he looks awkward too big clumsy i did not realize that he was beautiful and graceful until the first time he used my pool that afternoon i was tempted to seduce him but as little dignity as i have i had resolved to stick to older men so i shut off the thought outdoors at snug harbor wearing little or no clothes zebbie looked at homea mountain lion in grace and muscle an incident one later
