home planet had grave shortcomings before we tangled with the vermin no need to list them we all know that the four horsemen are ready to ride again but i can think of a very close analog of our home planet that would be far worse than earthzero even if it didnt have a single blackhat vermin on it go on one in which hitler got atomic weapons but we did not i cant see that vermin are more to be dreaded than hitlers ss corps the sadism of some human beingsnot just storm troopers you can find sadists in any country including the united statesis more frightening to me than any monster not to me deety blurted it out but my dear we dont know that those vermin are cruel we got in their way they tried to kill us they did not try to torture us there is a world of difference maybe there is pop but those things give me the creeps ill bet theyd torture us if they could my very dear daughter thats muddy thinking how old are you huh pop you know if anybody does i was reminding you f what you said you have the least years of experience i was much older than you are before i was cured of that sort of muddy thinking by jane your mother hilda jacob is telling you not to judge a book by its cover i said i learned it from jane too as jacob knows a creatures appearance tells nothing about its capacity for sadism jacob said does anyone have anything to add since it appears that i am not permitted to resign now i must rule on it we will complete the scheduled rotations jacob cleared his throat loudly looked at deety during my remaining hours in what zeb so accurately calls the worry seat i will endeavor to keep my orders straightut should i fail i ask that my attention be invited to it at once not saved up for a scolding later daughter okay pop aye aye captain thank you my dear is anyone tired or hungry no one spoke up jacob continued hilda will you take the conn no captainill omit the internal debate i held with myself jacob on his best behavior is hard to refuse very well my beloved

for a few seconds we were thrown around a bitdeety isnt the pilot zebbie is but she did get us leveled off i heard deety say gay deceiver hi deety hold course speed and heightaboveground got it girl youre a smart girl gay but we cant go on meeting like this over roger and out gay whew time out while the chief pilot has a nervous breakdown zebadiah what does that altimeter say seven klicks haboveg pop whats the probability of winding up this close to a planet without getting killed impossible to theorize deety maybe were dead and dont know it copilot deadman switch im going to check the air captain i yelped not now hilda im now am i still secondincommand if i am i must advise you you are about to make a bad mistake jacob hesitated i think he was counting my dear one if i am about to make a bad mistake i want your advice no matter what your status is thank you jacob you should not be guinea pig i should be i hilda youre pregnant all the more reason why i want the most competent and least expendable you zebbie and deetyto take care of yourselves in order to take care of me its my duty as science officer in any case whether im number two or not but jacob you are doing it just the way zebbie did it when we landed on marstenand thats all wrong thank you sharpie zebbie dear you risked your life and its not necessary zebbie interrupted me not necessary to waste juice this way yackyackyack copilot pipe down jacob said sharply gay bounce chief pilot when we reenter place the car on deadstick glide manual or automatic dont use juice now all hands listen to the science officer

unless it has been rewired it takes us back two klicks over a craterand thats not what we want the correct scram for this is t e r m i t e but thats just half of it deety has taught the sg how to ground herself nopower on any level bit of ground we can ground first then anyone can be guinea pig doesnt matter whoosh back to our stream bankbang open the doors zebbie said captain that makes sense sharpiei mean science officer may i apologize with a back rub you can apologize with a kiss but ill take the back rub too zebadiah dont commit yourself too far an air test isnt necessary pop captain
