got to find a new snug harbor comfortable as this car is we cant live in it indefinitely check sharpie your theory seems to be checking out is there any reason to finish this schedule should we go directly to teh axis zebbie granted that most rotations didnt amount to more than sightsee ing if we hadnt followed this schedule this car would not be nearly so comfortable do you know of another ford that has two bathrooms sharpie i dont know of one that has one bathroom our spacewarp special lets us stay in space as long as our air holds out and food but air is the critical factor i said zebbie have you noticed that our air does not get stuffy it will soon it need not jacob pointed out we can scramcode to oz or to wonderland in seconds sweet air no danger zebbie looked sheepish im still learning what our wonder buggy will do so am i gentlemen you missed my point you might check the juice i havent mentioned another asset zebbie would you like a banana sharpie i ate the last before i buried garbage while you and deety were washing dishes before we left wonderland tell him deety zebadiah hilda and i salvaged and put everything into the basket hilda started to put it into our wardrobeand it was heavy so we looked packed as tight as when we left oz six bananasand everything else cross my heart no go look hmmm jake can you write equations for a picnic basket that refills itself will it go on doing so zeb equations can be written to describe anything the description would be simpler for a basket that replenishes itself indefinitely than for one that does it once and stopsi would have to describe the discontinuity but i am no longer troubled by naturalor unnaturallaws that dont apply in universezero mmmm science officer i suggest that you check on that basket now that we have returned to universezero zebbie make that an order in writing and sign your nameif you want to look foolish deety will you order it logged sharpie if you werent such good company id strangle you your earlier answer recommended that we complete the rotations no i noted that the first twelve had not been unprofitable we could have completed the last three by now had we not spent time debating it hilda honey our cowardly astrogator needed time to get his nerve back by yumpin yiminy once youre all trained im going to retire we would simply recall you zebbie each will go on doing what she can do best time is out of joint  cursed spite that i was ever picked to set it right you misquoted i always do what universe do we hit next zebbie we have three rotations to go with four left on the fourvotes list one is useless but amusing and safe the other three are places to live but each has its own dangers as the chief of surgery used to say i dunno lets operate and find out zebbie sighed all hands stand by to rotate execute green fire rotate execute a formless red fog gay sagan mars looked like an old friend zebbie wiped his brow and said whew one to go capn deety hon lets get it over with sharpie fifteenth universeset i reported execute we came out into a starry universe capn deety hon dont these constellations look familiar zebbie commented i think so they are familiar i insisted except that there is a very bright star near the gemini that ought to be the sun were way out past pluto where the comets spend the winter lets move in and find earth dont be in a hurry said zebbie science officer what was that first rotation green fire how about the deadly green nebula in the legion of spaceon the trip to the runaway star where aladoree had been taken that was on your list all of us voted for it what was that red fog we rotated into next that one is harder to figure i admitted it could be any universe by a writer who paid respectful attention to astronomybova haldeman schmidt pournelle niven benford clement anderson and so forth but there were four votes for the mote in gods eye whether the two old gentlemen had anything to do with it or not i think we blundered into a red giant a red giant is close to what we call vacuum anyhow we werent hurt we were there about two seconds less than that sharpie you set it with one click and barely had your thumb off the execute button captain do you wish to transit toward that bright star lets chop off thirty or forty aus deety decided and get a rough cross fix maybe that will give us a disc pop can measure if not well narrow it down until it does then place us one au from the sun and well spot earth easily astrogatoradvice captain i advise making that first jump with wide offset miss the sun by at least one au at least yes zebadiah make that cross fix wide uh deety peered around theres the sickle have pop aim for regulus my husband said im swinging toward regulus zeb how do i take the angular width of the solar disc without broiling an eyeball the gunsight has a builtin polarizer didnt i show you you did not sorry captain deety hon i request permission to relieve the chief pilot for this permission granted but zebadiah you be careful spacecraft identify yourself the voice was everywhere zebbie jerked with surprise me too who said that lens man ted smith commander galactic patrol commanding patrol vessel nighthawk entity i regret being forced to enter your mind but you have been ignoring subether radio for four minutes thirtytwo seconds switch it on and i will get out of your
