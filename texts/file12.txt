first opportunity well get pants off all of us too without anything as childish as strip poker deety i want us to be a solid family and relaxed about it so that skin doesnt mean sex it just means we are home en famille your skin is pretty sexy nanny goat deety do you think im trying to make a pass at zebbie heavens no aunt hilda you would never do that piffle dear i dont have morals just customs i dont wait for a man to make a pass they fumble around and waste time but when i met him i picked zebbie for a chumso i gave him an opening he made a polite pass i carefully failed to see it and that ended it im sure hes as much fun on the workbench as you tell me he isbut bedmates are easy to find while worthwhile male friends are scarce zebbie is one to whom i can holler for help in the middle of the night and be certain hell rally around im not going to let that change merely because a weird concatenation now makes him my soninlaw besides deety although your old aunt sharpie may seem undignified i refuse to be the campus widow who seduces younger men save for minor exceptions close to my age i always have bedded older men when i was your age i tripped several three times my age educational it certainly is aunt hilda i got ninety percent of my instruction two years agoa widower three times my age i was programming for him and we took shared time when we could get it often after midnight i didnt think anything of it until one night i was startled to find that i was helping him to take off my panties then i was still more surprised to learn how little i had learned in seven years he gave me a tutored seminar usually three times a week all the time he was willing to spare mefor the next six months im glad i got tutoring from an expert before last night rolled aroundor zebadiah would have found me a dead arse willing but clumsy i didnt tell this to my darling i let him think he was teaching me thats right dear never tell a man anything he doesnt need to know and lie with a straight face rather than hurt his feelings or diminish his pride aunt nanny goat i just plain love you we quit yakking and looked for our men deety said that they were certain to be in the basement aunt hilda i dont go there without invitation its pops sanctum sanctorum youre warning me not to risk a faux pas im his daughter youre his wife not the same well he hasnt told me not toand today hell forgive me if ever where do you hide the stairs that bookcase swings out be darned for a socalled cabin this place is loaded with surprises a bidet in each bath didnt startle me jane would have required them your walkin freezer startled me only by being big enough for a restaurant but a bookcase concealing a priests holeas greataunt nettie used to say i do declare you should see our septic tankyours now ive seen septic tanks pesky thingsalways need pumping at the most inconvenient time this one wont have to be pumped over three hundred meters deep an even thousand feet for the love of why its an abandoned mine shaft below us that some optimist dug a hundred years back here was this big hole so pop used it there is a spring farther up the mountain pop cleaned that out covered it concealed it put pipe underground and we have lavish pure water under pressure the rest of snug harbor pop designed mostly from prefab catalogs fireproof and solid and heavily insulated we haveyou have i meanthis big fireplace and the little ones in the bedrooms but you wont need them other than for homeyness radiant heat makes it skincomfortable even in a blizzard where do you get your power from the nearest town oh no snug harbor is a hideout nobody but pop and meand now you and zebadiahknows its here power packs aunt hilda and an inverter in a space behind the back wall of the garage we bring in power packs ourselves and take them out the same way private oh the leasehold record is buried in a computer in washington or denver and the federal rangers know the leaseholds but they dont see us if we see or hear them first mostly they cruise on past once one came by on horseback pop fed him beer out under the treesand from outside this is just a prefab a living room and two shedroof bedrooms nothing to show that important parts are underground deety im beginning to think that this placethis cabincost more than my townhouse uh probably i think im disappointed sugar pie i married your papa because i love him and want to take care of him and promised jane that i would ive been thinking happily that my wedding present to my bridegroom would be his weight in bullion so that dear man need never work again dont be disappointed aunt hilda pop has to work its his nature me too work is necessary to us without it were lost well yes but working because you want to is the best sort of play correct thats what i thought i could give jacob i dont understand it jane wasnt rich she was on a scholarship jacob had no moneystill a teaching fellow a few months shy of his doctorate deety jacobs suit that he wore to be married in was threadbare i know that he pulled up from that he made full professor awfully fast i thought it was that and janes good management it was both that doesnt account for this forgive me deety
