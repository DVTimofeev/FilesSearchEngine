thirty of those thirtysix minutes can anyone think of a program that will let all of us nap this contact is more tiring than i had expected jacob deety zebdont all speak at once i can my dear i answered yes jacob gay termite to my mild surprise it was night at our creek bank to my pleasure my first attempt to maneuver by voice was smoothly successful my daughters ingenuity in constructing voiced programs had left me little to do while i did not resent it im proud of deety nevertheless while sitting as copilot i sometimes wondered whether anyone remembered that it was my brainchild that moved this chariot ah vanity to my greater pleasure hilda clapped her hands and looked delighted jacob how clever of you how stupid of me all right everyone off duty for a half hour cept the rule about always two and always a rifle gay alert us in thirty minutes and please unlock the bulkhead door aunt hillbilly are you going to sleep back there i had thought of stretching out and inviting jacob to join me but the space belongs to you and zebbie i was thoughtless we arent going to sleep but we had better drag those rifles out of that sack or you wont sleep i want to empty the oubliette and stow that pesky plastic potty under the cushion of my seat durned if ill use it when i have the whole outdoors at hand most certainlybut stay inside gays lightsand do please remind me before we leave deety ive so much on my mind that i forget housekeeping details hillbilly youre doing swell ill handle housekeeping you worry about the big picture hilda cuddled up to me in the after compartment and my nerves began to relax would the governor general relent where would we go next we had a myriad universes to choose from a myriad myriad planetsbut only one was home and we didnt dare go there what about juice for zebs car and a thousand other things perhaps we should risk earthwithoutaj what about the time bomb ticking away in my darlings belly hilda sniffed into my shoulder i patted her head relax dearest i cant jacob i dont like this job i snap at you you argue with me we both get upset its not good for uswe never behaved this way at snug harbor then give it up im going to after i finish the job i started jacob when we lift from this planet you will be captain oh no zeb hilda my only love you should turn it over to him now zebbie wont take it its you or deety jacob if deety is our next captain you will backseat drive even more than you have with me no jacob you must be captain before deety is so that you will understand what she is up against i felt that i had been scolded enough i started to tell hilda when that pejorative epithet played back in my mind backseat drive i trust that i am honest with myself i know that i am not very sociable and i expect to go on being so a man capable of creative work has no time to spare for fools who would like to visit but a backseat driver some facts jane learned to drive before i didher fathers duo our first car a roadable coincided with her pregnancy i got instruction so that i could drive for jane she resumed driving  after deety was born but when both of us were in the car i always drove she drove with me as passenger once or twice before the custom became establishedbut she never complained that i had been backseat driving but jane never complained deety laid it on the line i dont know who taught deety to drive but i recall that she was driving on roads as well as in the air when she was twelve or thirteen she had no occasion to drive for me until janes illness there was a time after we lost jane that deety often drove for me after a while we alternated then came a day when she was driving and i pointed out that her haboveg was oh some figure less than a thousand meters with a town ahead she said thanks popand grounded at that town an unplanned stop she switched off got out walked around and said shove over pop from now on ill enjoy the scenery while you herd us through the sky i didnt shove over so deety got into the back seat deety gets her stubbornness from both parents janes was covered with marshmallow that concealed chrome steel mine is covered with a coat of sullen anger if frustrated but deetys stubbornness isnt concealed she has a sweet disposition but torquemada could not force deety to do that which she decided against for four hours we ignored each other then i turned around intending to start an argument i supposei was in the mood for oneand deety was asleep curled up in the back seat i wrote a note stuck it to the wind screen left the keys got quietly out made sure all doors were locked hired another car and drove homeby air i was too angry to risk roading instead of going straight home i went to the commons to eat and found deety already eating so i took my tray and joined her she looked up smiled and greeted me hello pop how nice we ran into each other she opened her purse here are your keys i took them where is our car your car pop where you left it i left it you had the keys you were in the front seat you hold title you left a passenger asleep in the back seat good thing shes over eighteen isnt it she added there is an opel duo i have my eye
