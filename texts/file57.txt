wind of such thoughts yevgeny he does not believe that no good stupid britishers can excel us in anything so dont refer to that curious craft as advanced engineering a weird assemblage of poorly organized experiments would be better i will remember shall i loosen my holster and take off the safety to guard you sir the older man laughed you havent dealt with the damned british as long as i have never let them suspect that you are even mildly nervous and always be sure to insult him first bear in mind that the lowliest serf in ykraina is better than their socalled kingemperor that serf when zebbie interrupted trrtezl the younger hesitated but the older never broke stride instead he answered in french you are telling me to halt you british swine an officer of the tsar on russian soil i spit on your mother and your father if your mother can remember who he was why are you speaking french you soiled british spy you fool no one speak russianor if you are uncultured speak english

captain i cant zebbie nodded and opened the mike spoke in english we are not british not spies we are american tourists and american what nonsense is this he had shifted to english a british colonial is still britishand a spy my husband reached over shut off the microphone captain i advise lifting he wont listen to reason copilot not till i must we dont even have enough water i must try to parley zebbie thumbed the switch i am not a british colonial i am zeb carter of california a citizen of the united states of america i have my passport if we have trespassed we regret it and apologize spy that is the most boldfaced bluff i have ever heard there is no such country as the united states of america i am placing you under arrest in the name of his imperial majesty the tsar of all the russias by authority delegated to me by his viceroy for new russia grand duke fyodor ivanovitch romanov i arrest you and your party for the crime of espionage open up by now they had reached gay deceiver and were at the portside door zebbie answered you havent told me your name much less identified yourself as a russian officer or shown any authority over what is clearly unoccupied land what preposterous i am colonel the count morinosky of novy kiev of the viceroys imperial guard as for my authority look at the sky around you the selfproclaimed colonel drew his pistol reversed it and used the butt to pound on the door open up i said zebbie has good temper and calm judgment both are likely to slip if anyone abuses gay deceiver he said softly colonel your craft on the ground aheadis there anyone in it eh of course not its a twoseater as anyone can see my private scoutabout never mind that keep quiet and open up zebbie again switched off his microphone gay deceiver at command execute burn one tenth of a second at point of aim intensity four gotcha boss colonel how can you take four prisoners in a twoseater simple you and i will ride in your vehicle the other members of your party will be hostage for your good behavior and will ride where assigned you wont see which craft lest you get foolish ideas my pilot will fly my craft execute the grounded ornithopter began to burn fiercelybut the colonel did not see it we saw itbut he was looking at zebbie zebbie said colonel please stand clear of the door so that i can open it oh very well colonel look the younger officer in stepping back caught sight of the fireand i have rarely heard such anguish or an instant later in the colonels face such astonishment switching to rage he attempted to shoot zebbiewith his hand still gripping the barrel of his pistol in a moment he realized what he was doing and flipped it to catch it by the grip i never saw whether or not he made the catch capn zebbie commanded gay bounce and the scene blacked out while the colonels hand was open for the catch zebbie was saying jake i lost my temper i should not have done it it ruined our last chance to deal with those russians but i hope it taught the ruddy snarf not to go around hammering dents into other peoples cars captain you did not ruin our last chance we never had one you ran into classic russian xenophobia the commies didnt invent that attitude it goes back at least a thousand years read your history jacob added im not sorry you burned his kite i wish he had to walk home regrettably one of his craft will pick him up jake if i could afford toin juice in timei would go back and keep him from being picked up harry them not let them land i wont hmm shall we fall a bit farther and see what they are doing before we
