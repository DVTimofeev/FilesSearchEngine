the cape off her shoulders suddenly pulled it around her again whos coming up the hill i looked up saw that jake and hilda had reached the pooland a figure was appearing from below beyond the boulder that dammed it i dont know stay behind me i hurried toward the pool the stranger was dressed as a federal ranger as i closed in i heard the stranger say to jake are you jacob burroughs why do you ask

sequence i told him you havent identified yourself dont be funny the stranger said you know this uniform im bennie hibol the ranger hereabouts i answered most carefully mr highball you are a man in a uniform wearing a gun belt and a shield that doesnt make you a federal officer show your credentials and state your business the uniformed character sighed i got no time
