bean devonshire royal fusiliers may i ask to whom i am speaking very well i will speak slowly please record i am captain hilda burroughs commanding space yacht gay deceiver out of snug harbor in the americas captain let me get this clear are you commanding both a spaceship in orbit and a landing craft from your ship either way please let me have the elements of your ships orbit for my log and tell me the present position of your landing craft then i can assign you a berth to ground do i have your word as a british officer and gentleman that you will not shoot us out of the sky as those russian vandals attempted to do madamcaptainyou have my word gay bounce we are now approximately fortynine thousand feet above your city but we understood you to say sixteen thousand that was five minutes ago this craft is fast aunt hilda released the button deety get rid of the special tramp program i told gay to return tramp to her perms and to wipe the temporary mods done aunt hilda pressed the mike button do you see us now she released the button deety i want us over that big buildingimperial house probablyin one transition can you tell zebbie and jacob what it takes i looked it over we should be at the edge of the citybut were we get a range and triangulate no time guess at the answer double it and divide by two arc tan four tenths pop can you transit twentyone degrees from vertical toward city hail twentyone degrees sixtynine degrees of dive toward the big barn in the park relative bearing broad on the port bow approxset one unit transition ten klicksset  can see you now i do believe came mr beans voice barely well come lower aunt hilda chopped off the lieutenant zebbie put her into glide as soon as you execute deety watch haboveg and scram if necessarydont wait to be told zebbie execute at will jake executeand we were down so fast i got goose bumps especially as zebadiah then dived vertically to gain glide speed and thats mushy slow slow on mars but soon aunt hilda was saying tranquilly we are over imperial house you see us yes yes my word bloody leftenant watch your language aunt hilda winked at me and snickered silently madam i apologize captain if you please she said smiling while her voice dripped icicles captain i apologize accepted where am i to ground ah figured from imperial house there is a landing field due south of it twelve miles i will tell them to expect you hilda let up on the button said gay bounce and racked the microphone how unfortunate that the lieutenants radio cut out before he could tell us how far away that field is or was it our radio i said captain you know durn well both radios worked okay mercy i must be getting old was smart girl in recording mode i said she always is during maneuvers she wipes it in a tenhour cycle then my bad hearing doesnt matter please ask her to repeat the lieu tenants last speech i did and gay did deety can you have her wipe it right after the word it auntie you aint goin to heaven i had gay wipe twelvemilesiwilltellthemtoexpectyou but you wouldnt know anybody there probably not dear zebbie how does one have smart girl ground herself without juice deety had better go over it again unlessjake will you explain it its deetys caper i could use another drill all right i agreed switch off gays ears zebadiah gay can make any transition exactly if she knows precisely where her target is even a jump of less than one minimum i found that out the day we got here when we were testing remote control the rest came from perfecting the bugout routine by having her pause and sweep the target and if its obstructed she bounces aunt hilda if you intend to ground we had better not be much under five klicks or well have to bounce and start over ive got air bite captain ill stretch it thanks zebbie deety you do it let us all learn okay i need both pilots you havent said where to ground wasnt that clear due south of imperial house i think it is a parade ground nothing on it but a flagpole on the north side put her down in front of the building but miss that flagpole it would take override to hit that flagpole zebadiah gunsight the spot you want to park on ill talk to gay then put her in level flight in the orientation you want and give execute pop gay should pause at exactly onehalf klick to see that her parking spot is clear and to recheck distance that stop wont be longa fraction of a secondbut if she fails to make it try to bounce probably you cant if i missed in debugging maybe well all be radioactive been nice knowing you all okay switch on her ears my husband did so gay deceiver hello deety ive missed you unpowered autogrounding mode gonna ground by myself without a drop of juice where new target code word parade ground point of aim and rangefinder method show him to me i can lick him i touched my husbands shoulder let her know on target gay steady on target range threeseventwonine threesevennaughtynought threefivenineninegot him deety zebadiah leveled us out headed us north execute we were parked facing the big front steps that flagpole was ten meters from gays nose pop said deety i could see the check stop but it was too short for me to act but your programs always work until the day one blows up aunt hilda what do we do now we wait xxvi the keys to the city jake i do not believe that i am wrong in insisting
