and ill consider it i kept my blinkin mouf shut my husbands fibs entertain me if they are fibs grandpa zach was as cantankerous an old coot as youll ever meet hated government hated lawyers hated civil servants hated preachers hated automobiles public schools and telephones was contemptuous of most editors most writers most professors most of almost anything but he overtipped waitresses and porters and would go out of his way to avoid stepping on an insect grandpa had three doctorates biochemistry medicine and lawand he regarded anyone who couldnt read latin greek hebrew french and german as illiterate zebbie can you read all those fortunately for me my grandfather had a stroke while filling out a tax form before he could ask me that question i dont know hebrew i can read latin puzzle out greek speak and read french read technical german understand it in some accents swear in russianvery usefuland speak an ungrammatical smattering of spanish picked up in cantinas and from horizontal dictionaries grandpa would have classed me as subliterate as i dont do any of these welland i sometimes split infinitives which would have infuriated him he practiced forensic medicine medical jurisprudence was an expert witness in toxicology pathology and traumatology bullied judges terrorized lawyers medical students and law students he once threw a tax assessor out of his office and required him to return with a search warrant setting forth in detail its constitutional limitations he regarded the income tax and the seventeenth amendment and the direct primary as signs of the decay of the republic how did he feel about the nineteenth hilda grandpa zach supported female suffrage i remember hearing him say that if women were so dadburned foolish as to want to assume the burden they should be allowed tothey couldnt do the country more harm than men had votes for women didnt annoy him but nine thousand other things did he lived at a slow simmer always ready to break into a rolling boil he had one hobby collecting steel engravings steel engravings i repeated of dead presidents my princess especially of mckinley cleveland and madisonbut he didnt scorn those of washington he had that instinct for timing so necessary to a collector in  on black thursday he held not one share of common stock instead he had sold short when the  bank holiday came along every olddollar he owned except current cash was in zurich in swiss money eventually us citizens were forbidden by emergency decree to own gold even abroad grandpa zach ducked into canada applied for swiss citizenship got it and thereafter split his time between europe and america immune to inflation and the confiscatory laws that eventually caused us to knock three zeros off  the olddollar in creating the newdollar so he died rich in locarnobeautiful place i stayed with him two summers as a boy his will was probated in switzerland and the us revenue service could not touch it most of it was a trust with its nature known to his offspring before his death or i would not have been named zebadiah female descendants got prorata shares of income with no strings attached but males had to have first names starting with zand even that got them not one swiss franc there was a root hog or die clause zachariah believed in taking care of daughters but sons and grandsons had to go out and scratch with no help from their fathers until they had earned and saved on their ownor accumulated without going to jailassets equal to one prorata share of the capital sum of the trust before they shared in the trusts income sexism said aunt hilda raw unadulterated sexism any femlib gal would sneer at his dirty old money on those terms would you have refused it sharpie me zebbie dear are you feverish i would have both greedy hands out im strong for womens rights but no fanatic sharpie wants to be pampered and thats what men are best attheir natural function pop do you need help in coping with her no son i like pampering hilda i dont see you abusing my daughter i dont dare you told me shes vicious at karate i am good at karate pop made sure that i learned all the dirty fighting possible but not against zebadiah if i ever doheaven forbidfind myself opposed to my husband ill quiver my chin and cry on my graduation from high school my father had a talk with me zeb he told me the time has come ill put you through any school you choose or you can take what you have saved strike out on your own and try to qualify for a share in your grandfathers will suit yourself i shant influence you folks i had to think my fathers younger brother was past forty and still hadnt qualified the size of the trust made a prorata of its assets amount to a requirement that a male descendant had to get rich on his ownwelltodo at leastwhereupon he was suddenly twice as rich but with over half of this countrys population living on the taxes of the lesser number it is not as easy to get rich as it was in grandpas day turn down a paidfor education at princeton or mit or go out and try to get rich with nothing but a high school educationi hadnt learned much in high school i had majored in girls so i had to think hard and long almost ten seconds i left home next day with one suitcase and a pitiful sum of money wound up on campus that had two things to recommend it an aerospace rotc that would pick up part of my expenses and a phys ed department willing to award me a jockstrap scholarship in exchange for daily bruises and contusions plus allout effort whenever we played i took the deal what did you play
