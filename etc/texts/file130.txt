mind do not maneuver we have weapons on you captain jacob whispered hilda is set to rotate deety shook her head touched zebbies arm pointed to herself lensman this is captain deety commanding continua craft gay deceiver we dont have subether radio do you read me  read you loud and clear what happened to your subether radio do you need help captain smith i dont have subether radio at all we dont need help but could use astrogational advice where are we the important point is that you are in my patrol sector an unscheduled ship insufficiently identified i repeat do not maneuver by order of the galactic patrol do you understand i understand you lensman i regret having intruded into your patrol space this is a private ship engaged in peaceful exploration that is what i am about to determine captain stay where you are make no hostile moves and you will be safe lensman can you see through my eyes are you inviting me to do so certainly use my eyes use my ears but dont try to take over my mind or this ship will disappear deety squeezed my shoulder i signaled roger with a pat  warn you not to maneuver ah interesting i snapped captain smith quit threatening us a lensman is supposed to be an officer and gentleman i intend to report you to the port admiral youre an oaf sorry madam i do not wish to offend but i have duty to perform captain will you please turn your head so that i can see who is speaking certainly let me introduce all of us on my leftdeety looked at zebbie is doctor zebadiah carter in front of him is doctor jacob burroughs on his rightdeety looked at meis his wife doctor hilda burroughs xenobiologist and chief of science let me offer you this advice lensman it is never safe to offend doctor hilda i gathered that impression captain doctor hilda i would not willingly offendbut i have duties shall i get out of your mind entirely if you speak to me i will hear with captain deetys ears she can if she will repeat to you my thought in answer oh its all right for conversation but dont try to go deeper mentor would not like itas you know doctor hilda your mention of certain entity surprises mefrom one who is not a lensman i dont need a lens you can check that with arisia deety said hastily lensman are you satisfied that we are a peaceful party of scientists or is there something more that you wish to know captain i can see that this ship is not a pirate vesselunarmed and unarmoured oh i note controls for a coherent light gun but that wouldnt be much use to a pirate nor can i visualize two men and two women attempting to attack a space liner but keeping the peace is just one of my responsibilities your ship small as it is could be carrying millions of credits in contraband say what you mean lensman i snapped drugs but dont use the word zwilnik mentally we could hear him sigh yes doctor hildadrugs but i did not introduce that offensive word into the discussion i heard you thinking it dont do it again lensman deety said quickly we have medical drugs the only one that could interest you is a few milligrams of morphine but we carry no thionite no bentlam no hadive no nitrolabe you are using your lens you know that im telling the truth captain its not that easy before i hailed you i did try a slight probe please doctor hilda it was in line of duty ive never encountered minds so fully blocked and this is a most curious craft it is obviously designed for aerodynamic use rather than space yet here you areand i cant see how you got here i have no choice but to detain you and to examine this ship thoroughly if necessary take it apart piece by piece lensman deety said earnestly dont be hasty you can search more thoroughly by lens than by other means go ahead weve nothing to hide and we have a great deal to offer the patrol but you wont get it by pushing us around you certainly wont capn lets leave im tired of stupidityand i snapped gay sagan marszero was on our starboard bow that dead rock looked awfully good to me zebbie said captain did you order the copilot to execute i said dont bother deety with it zebbie i did it without permission solely my decision zebbie frowned unhappily sharpie i thought you would be our model girl scout while deety is skipper why zebbie you can rotate back there in no time but i would like to be dropped first imperial house or minusj somewhere why hilda my husband asked jacob meet your friendly neighborhood zwilnik commander ted smith of the galactic patrola fine officer im certain as dr e e smith saw to it that no unworthy person could ever wear the lenswas getting unpleasantly close thats why i was so fierce with the poor man deety said but aunt hilda e e smiths world is just the sort of world weve been seeking maybe well go back but not until ive had a chance to dump two pounds of concentrated extract of cannabis magnifica dr wheatstone tells me that it is incredibly valuable in therapy as the base for endless drugs but i had a hunch that commander smith would confiscate it impound the smart girl arrest all of usand convict me but that isnt all zebbie doctor smith created one of the most exciting universes i know of to read about not to live in with that endless boskone warmust have been going on they were looking for zwilniksyou have to be as smart as kimball kinnison to stay alive and even he gets chopped up now
