that zeb should lead us i am forced to conclude that being right has little to do with holding a womans affections i never intend to hurt hildas feelings i now plan to make a career of keeping my mouth shut but i do not think it was diplomatic to spat with that radio operator or proper to bewell yes ruderude to his officer as for grounding twelve miles nineteen klicks from where we were told tois this the behavior of guests but we did ground where we should not have i started to open the door to get out then help hilda to disembark when i heard her say we wait hilda added leave doors locked and belts fastened gay deceiver remain in maneuvering mode lock the bulkhead door hot and rarin to go hilda bulkhead door locked youre a smart girl gay that makes two of us hilda chief pilot in this mode does she record outside as well as inside she does if i switch on outside speakers and mikes captain please do what volume captain outside and inside i didnt know they were separate straightline gain logarithmic maam from a gnats whisper to a small earthquake i would like outside pickup to amplify enough that we wont miss anything what i send out should be a bit forceful captain ill give you a decibel advantage you want it louder squeeze my shoulder i wont turn it higher than sevenunless you want to use it as a weapon but to talk privately inside i have to keep switching off then on as with the russiansremember oh yes all hands i will speak for all of us if anyone needs to speak to me attract zebbies attention slap my shoulder and hell give us privacy and confirm it with thumbsup dont ask for it unnecessarily hilda why these complex arrangements here comes someone now it would be polite to go meet them in any case we can open the door to talk these are not russians i simply could not bear to watch my darling handle this delicate matter with suchwell rudeness was i thanked copilot pipe down all hands we may go upstairs any instant report readiness for space astrogator ready captain chief pilot still ready outside audio hot copilot im checking this door seal again earlier i started to open it there ready for space hilda i dont think correct but the chief pilot did think and gave me thumbsup as soon as you started to talk pipe down chief pilot cut in our sender as soon as one of them speaks copilot call me captain as the others do protocol applies ill explain family relationships later when appropriate i resolved not to open my mouth for any reason feeling quite disgruntled disgruntled i found myself giving serious thought to whether or not hildas temporary and inappropriate authority could do permanent harm to her personality but the top of my mind was observing the lord high executioner approaching us flanked by two henchmen he was wearing a uniform more suited to musical comedy than to the field fierce moustaches sunburnpink complexion service ribbons and a swagger cane completed the effect his henchmen were younger not so fancy fewer ribbons and appeared to be sergeants i could not read the officers shoulder straps a crown i thought but was there a pip beside it he strode toward us and was ten meters from my door when hilda said firmly thats close enough please tell the governor general that captain burroughs has grounded as directed and awaits his pleasure he stopped briefly and bellowed you were not directed to land here youre supposed to be at the field customs immigration health inspection visas tourist cards intelligence i saw hilda squeeze zebs shoulder quiet her voice came more loudly from outside than from her despite gays soundproofing zeb reduced gain as she continued my good man send one of your ratings to the governor general to deliver my message while we wait state your name rank and regiment i shall make formal report of your behavior preeeposterous  behavior unbecoming an officer and a gentleman hilda said with gentle sweetness since you insist while you wont tell your name like a naughty boy others know it the paymaster the governor general others she squeezed zebs shoulder deliver my message im colonel brumby chief constable of the imperial household and not your messenger boy open up im going to parade you before the governor generalunder arrest hilda said quietly to zeb sevenallowed the chief constable to stride two more steps before saying stop my ears hurt all three stopped the old fool braced himself and started again hilda must have poked zeb he answered with thumbsup back to normal volume but be ready with that earthquake he nodded she went on leftenant colonel is it not i dont see that extra pip leftenant colonel i warn you for your own safety not to come closer he did not answer kept coming took his cane from under his arm his sergeants followedslowly at a respectful distance hilda let him reach my doori could see a network of broken veins on his noseand for the second time in two days someone started to pound on gays door he raised his cane stop that i was deafened the chief constable was missing the sergeants were a long way back they stopped running turned and faced us i looked down through my doors port saw a pair of legs and a swagger caneinferred a torso i turned my head saw that zeb had his thumb up captain he said i disobeyed you how zebbie i gave him an eight i wasnt sure his heart could take a ten he looks like an old bottleaday man an eight may have been too much i commented hes on the ground dead maybe oh i hope not unlikely captain zeb told her shall i tell his noncoms
