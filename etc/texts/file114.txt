total absence of existence of any sort different physical laws a different topology we may be seeing the totality of this universe a small universe with a different sort of closed space i cant visualize it jake deety my dear rephrase it for your husband ill try pop zebadiah the geometry of this place may require different postulates from those that work back home im sure you have played with mbius strips a surface with only one side one edge but this is a sphere pop is saying that it may be a sphere with only one side the inside have you ever tried to figure out a klein bottle i got crosseyed and a headache this could be a kleinbottle sort of thing it might turn out that if you tunneled straight down anywhere down there you would emerge at the opposite point still inside and that straight line might be shorter than the distance across maybe much shorter point threeoneeightthreezeronine is the ratio by the simplest postulates i agreed but the geometry may not be that simple however zeb assuming that this is a total universe our chances of arriving in open space were far greater than the chance of conflicting with a mass but i would not wish to homestead herepretty as it is nevertheless we might check for obstetricians no obstetricians zeb answered firmly why i demanded if there are human beings here they do not have an advanced culture deety has been following that river did you notice where that other river joined it also look ahead where it meets the sea no cities no warehouses no river traffic no air traffic no signs of roads yet this is choice real estate therefore no advanced culture anywhere and a small population if any if anyone wants to refute me please do so in the next two minutes deety cant hold this heap in the air much longer without using juice i check you zebbie they might be so advanced that they can make the whole joint look like a park i wouldnt bet on it deety i asked aunt hilda is right captain but its so pretty hilda expend one film as a souvenir then we rotate my daughter nosed the car down to permit a better picture a click got it hilda cried gaysagan mars of universezero lay to starboard zeb sighed im glad to be out of there sharpie did you get a picture cant rush it my wife answered nnnn yup picture coming good zebbie i thought you didnt like that insideout world i dont if that picture is sharp you two knockedup broads werent hit by radiation where it counts any fogging no zebbie and brighter color every second herelook zeb brushed it aside my sole interest is in radiation captain im having misgivings weve tried five out of fifteen and only one was even vaguely homelike the pickings have been slim and the dangers excessive but we know that earth analogs tau and teh axes are earthlike with monsters put in hilda tau axis probably we havent explored teh axis jake are we justified in exposing our wives to dangers we cant imagine in a moment copilot astrogator why did you rotate i dont think i ordered it i have been trying to run a taut ship so have i captain i must ask to be relieved as astrogator i am sorry to say that i have been thinking along the same lines my dearest but you had better explain captain three times you have replaced me at the conn without relieving me the last time i let it continue wondering and waiting just now we were losing altitude dangerously so i acted now i ask to be relieved hilda seemed calm and not angry but resolved had i really done anything out of line it did not seem so to me zeb have i been overriding the officer at the conn zeb took too long to answer captain this is a time when a man must insist on written orders i will make a written reply hmm i said i think you have replied deety what do you think more written orders i dont need written orders pop youve been utterly stinking you really feel so i know so aunt hilda is right you are dead wrong she understated the case you assign her responsibilitiesthen ignore her just now she carried out her assigned dutiesand you chewed her out for it of course she wants to be relieved my daughter took a deep breath and went on and you bawled her out for ordering a scram escape twentyseven minutes ago you saidand i quote all handswe are all free at all times to use any of the escape programs to get us out of danger end of quotation pop how can you expect orders to be obeyed when you cant remember what orders youve given nevertheless we have obeyed you every time and no back talkand weve all caught hell aunt hilda caught the mostbut zebadiah and i caught quite a bit pop youve been i wont say it i wont i looked out the port at mars for long unhappy minutes then i turned around ive no choice but to resign effective as i ground her family i must admit to great humiliation i had thought that i was doing quite well uh back to our streamside i think gay gaydeceiveroverride not on your tintype youll serve as long as i did not a second less but sharpie is right in refusing to take the conn under you youve been mistreating her despite being a colonel you have never learned that you cant assign responsibility without delegating authority to match and then respect it jake youre a lousy boss were going to keep you in the hot seat until you learn better but theres no reason for sharpie to resign over your failings i still have something to
