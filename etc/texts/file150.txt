it not do we take prisoners or cut their throats which would you rather do captain lor please do all the talking these whipsaw conversations are hard to follow by the way no more midnight mutinies lor you remain captain until further notice again they looked at each other we like to swap off calling it mutiny is just a joke no one asked your preferences my chief of staff and secondincommand of the flagship is the only one who does and must advise me if you have opinions to offer see him answer my question captain lor well do what you order but our brother who was our father at the time taught us never to kill if we could possibly avoid it while teaching us all sorts of ways to kill and made us practice when we were growing up we always wanted to be pirates then we grew up and decided that it could never be and tried to forget it sharpie said i think im making you tonguetied by forcing you to filter it through one set of vocal cords so cancel that order you two are unique we operate just the way lazarus taught you so far we have killed only onceto repel an attack on us that air army we timed it caught them with their flying machines on the ground burned the machines burned their fueland thereby stopped an invasion without killing anyone but we are always ready to kill lor thats why i warned you a few minutes ago it would have broken gays heart to have to destroy dora skullandcrossbones no way to fly one but if you want to hang one in the lounge i grant permission why did you decide not to become pirates that same preliminary glance babies laz has three i have four because lor has one pair of twins and we try to be pregnant at the same time and time it to fit our plans and brothers plans if you ever let him out of hack how old are you two ive been thinking of you as about deetys age but you cant be just one of you answer please its a simple question they conferred mentally an unusually long time at last captain lor said slowly it isnt quite simple we will get dora and athene to integrate it for us if data are complete they may not be but answering in oldhometerran years and meaning our own biological time laz thinks we are about fortyeight and i think we are a couple of years younger it doesnt matter because ishtar will tell us when to rejuvenate which wont be soon as we arent yet close to menopause does it have to be at menopause oh no just makes it easier and you never have to stop making babies but ishtars mother went years past menopause and had decided to die and changed her mind and looks younger than we do and has had more babies than we have this time around i mean how often do men need it sharpie asked jake looked up and said i wont need it for another six weeks hilda maybe seven shush dear lazlor be careful around my husband when hes in rut it takes heavy chains to restrain him so never mind that question he doesnt need to know and for me it was intellectual curiosity of a biologist perhaps it s best to ask doctor ishtar yes commodore that would be best we arent biologists were ship handlers i leaned forward sharpie was keeping us in the car why i didnt know then commodore im required to advise you yes zebbie you are going to need a new chief of staff a new secondincommand and a new astrogator because i will be on the binnacle list in a wet pack if you dont have lazlor answer that last one it is not intellectual curiosity to me why zebbie dear i have reports that your curve is such that it will be many many years before you can possibly have other than intellectual interest if it were not for upsetting jake i would paddle that pert little arse deety said hear hear i placed my hand over her mouth and got bitten sharpie said captain we have here another paradoxdoctors carter and burroughs each unreasonably insecure elizabeth youve been a man give them the male angle commodore i wasnt very successful as a male i simply took antigeria whenever lazarus did but i can report his thumb rule yes when a man looks at a new and attractive woman and decides that he is too tired its time when he doesnt even look push him over and bury him hes failed to notice that hes dead the ships computer said something in that notspanish sharpie answered graz dora ill come now lor said maam we didnt know you knew galacta i dont but i will a week from now i knew what i would say in your position and you said it i could tell from cognates you told dora to get him out pronto because the doa was on her way then get his personal belongings when i would not be inconvenienced so i stalled zebbie will you come with me jacob dearest will you decide whether or not we should give up our suite with the carters and what to move out of gay we will be in dora at least a week possibly longer commodore we depart for tertius tomorrow midday ships time i do not recall ordering that captain lor the twins looked at each otherand said nothing sharpie patted lazs cheek dont look so thunderstruck girlsgirlsseven years or so sharpies senior and seven babies between themon reaching tertius place us in orbit following local rules but no messages from ship to ground unless approved by me in writing come now as sharpie left with me in tow she told deety that
