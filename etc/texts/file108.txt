military governors perhaps in a hundred years it wont matter although i see us as morally superior how bertie a russian might see this differently our transportees are malefactors under our lawsbut once here they are as free as other englishmen oh they must wear the broad arrow until dischargedbut at home they would wear it in a grim prison the russian prisoners are if our intelligence is correct the people they used to send to the siberian salt mines political prisoners they are serfs but i am told that most of them were not serfs in russia whether they are treated better or worse than serfs in russia i do not know but one thing i do know they work their fields with men we work ours with wogs and whip them suddenly i was angry we had an argument bertie maintaining that the whips were not used unnecessarily i asserting that i had seen it with my own eyes i guess he won as he told us that they had to muzzle the beasts in weed fields or they would stuff themselves on it pass out wake somewhat do it again and starvebut the muzzles were designed to allow them to chew a blade at a time all day long to keep them happy the raw weed is addictive to wog and man we wont allow a man to work in the fields more than three months at a time and pull him out if he cant pass the weekly medical tests as for wogs deetyyes we exploit them human beings exploit horses cattle sheep poultry and other breeds are you vegetarian i admitted i was not but i dont want to eat wogs nor do we in windsor colony wog meat goes only to wogs and wogs dont care in the wild they eat their own dead kill and eat their aged captain hilda thats all the defense i can offer i admit that it doesnt sound as strong as i had always believed captain id like to put one to bertie jacob i treasure your thoughts bertie would you polish off the russians if you could bertie snorted thats academic doctor i dont command the force it would take i cant set up a string of stockpilesand wouldnt know what to do with them if i could i dont have the troops or thopters but i must add if my king tells me to fight i will fight aunt hilda told bertie to wash dishes with pop sent along as guard as soon as they started down aunt hilda said we are going to do it to a maximum cost of one power pack deety start working on a program stringing together the dumps we located last night already have i told her in my head last night to put me to sleep you want it preprogrammed i would rather tell gay each bounce i would do it your way hon the purpose in sending bertie to wash dishes and jacob to guard him was to get them out of the way while i rig a frameup at the end of the coming run we drop bertie and bounce and at that instant i cease to be captain i want to hold the election nowa oneballot railroad i will ask for nominations zebbie you nominate jacob deety you dont need to say anything but speak if you wish if jacob nominates either of you dont argue ill rig it so that bertie declares the ballots if you two are with me the only surprise will be that fourth vote three for jacob and lets all write jacob not pop or jake and one for the dark horse are you with me wait a half sharpie why not give deety a crack at it not me deety should have the experience but please zebbie not this time jacob has given me a dreadful time endless insubordination i want to pass him on to deety well tenderized deety ought not to have to put up with her father secondguessing her decisionsand if you two help she wont have to i want to give my beloved the goddamndest white mutiny ever one that he will remember with shudders and never again give a skipper any lip sounds good i agreed but i dont know what a white mutiny is sweetheart my husband told me its killing him with kindness he says frog we hop utter and literal obedience this he wont like pop will love it so would you like to command zombies who never make suggestions and carry out orders literally without a grain of common sense fifteen minutes later bertie read off jacob and this reads jacob and so does this one that seems to settle it but here is one folded a bunch of smarties you three think i didnt guess why you sent me down to ride shot gun very well i vote for myself it is signed jake madame speaker is that valid quite jacob my last order will be liftoff after we drop bertie bertie said jake i think congratulations are in order pipe down all hands prepare for space a piece of cake bertie called it we started at the easternmost dump worked west pop out at four klicks and dive a dry run to size up the target where wood alcohol was stored ornithopters on the ground and how arranged while gay ululated from intensity six to eight frightfulness i did not let it go up to ten because it wasnt intended to damage but to send anyone on target scattering zebadiahs idea captain ive got nothing against russians my only purpose is to burn their fuel and their flaphappies to make it difficult to attack our friendsand i dont mean you big brass bertie i mean the transportee maid who brought us tea this morning and brian bean and mr wheatstone who was a top surgeon before some fool judge
