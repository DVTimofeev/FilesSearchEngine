second is loads of time for the human eye i hoped that colonel frimpsky had been watching when gay popped up and blinked out five klicks haboveg captain thanks jake the board showed dive ratestraight downof over seven hundred kilometers per hour and increasing so fast that the units figure was an unreadable blur and the tens place next to it was blinking one higher almost by the second most carefully i eased her out of dive and gently slowly opened her wings part way for more lift as she slowed while making a wide clockwise sweep to the eastslowed her dive that is not her speed through the air when i had completed that sweep and straightened out headed for that column of smoke on course west i was making over eight hundred kilometers per hour in unpowered glide and still had almost a klick haboveg i could turn into greater speed not that i needed it i had satisfied myself by eye of what i had been certain of by theory an ornithopter is slow jake said worriedly may i ask the captain his plans im going to give colonel pistoisky something to remember us by gay deceiver still aboard boss i kept my eye on the flappy birds still in the air while i let gay fly herself those silly contraptions could not catch us but there was always a chance that a pilot might dodge the wrong way most of them seemed anxious to be elsewhere they were lumbering aside right and left i looked at the smokedead aheadand saw what i had not noticed before an ornithopter beyond the smoke jake gasped but said nothing we were on collision course closing at about  kmshr most of it ours suicide pilot idiot panicked and frozen i let him get within one klick of us which brought us almost to the smoke and near the deck about  meters habovegand i yelped scout yes deety is a careful programmer the sky was black we were ten klicks haboveg and so far as i could tell the same barren hills under us that we had left five minutes earlierand i was feeling cocky my sole regret was that i would not hear colonel snarfsky try to explain to the grand duke the ghost craft now used by british spies did russian nobility practice honorable harakiri perhaps the loadedpistol symbol you know that one the officer in disgrace returns to his quarters and finds that someone has thoughtfully loaded his pistol and placed it on his deskhereby saving the regiment the scandal of a court i didnt want the bliffy dead but busted to buck private with time to reflect on politeness and international protocol while he cleaned stables i checked our heading found that we were still pointed west gay deceiver scout black sky again the same depressing landscape copilot is it worthwhile to tilt down for a better look that either takes juicenot much but some or it takes time to drop far enough to bite air and do it with elevons we cant afford to waste either time or juice captain i dont think this area is worth scouting careful of that participle better say exploring captain may i say something deety if you are speaking as astrogator you not only may but must i could reprogram to put us lower if i knew what altitude was just high enough to let you use elevons conserve both time and juice i mean it seems to be about eight klicks haboveg usually hard to say since we dont have a sealevel shall i change angle to arrive at eight klicks haboveg how long does it take us to fall two klicks when we arrive she barely hesitated thirtytwo and a half seconds only half a minute seems longer threetwo point six seconds captain if this planet has the same surface gravity as mars in our own universethreesevensix centimeters per second squared ive been using it and havent run into discrepancies but i dont see how this planet holds so much atmosphere when marsour marshas so little this universe may not have the same laws as ours ask your father hes in charge of universes yes sir shall i revise the program deety never monkey with a system that is working well enoughfirst corollary of murphys law if it is an area as unattractive as this well simply get out if it has possibilities half a minute isnt too long to wait and the additional height will give us a better idea of the whole area gay deceiver scout we all gasped thirty kilometers and those barren hills were gone the ground was green and fairly leveland a river was in sight or a canal oh boy copilot dont let me waste juicebe firm with me deety count seconds everybody eyeball his sector report anything interesting deety started chanting  thirteen fourteen fifteen and each second felt like ten i took my hands off the controls to keep from temptation that was either a canal or a stream that had been straightened revetted and maintained for years maybe eons professor lowell had been right right theory wrong universe deety how far is the horizon seventeenabout two hundred fifty klickstwenty i placed my hands gently on the controls hon thats the first time youve ever used the word about with reference to a number twentyfourinsufficient datatwentysix you can stop counting i felt aquiver i put a soft nosedown pressure on the elevons and decided to leave her wings spread we might want to stretch this one insufficient data zebadiah it was changing steadily and you had me counting seconds horizon distance at ten klicks height above ground should be within one percent of two hundred and seventy kilometers that assumes that this planet is a perfect sphere and that it is exactly like mars in our universeneither is true it ignores refraction effects tricky even at homeand unknown
