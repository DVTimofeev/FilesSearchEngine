figured out how to do a laundry nothing for a tub no way to heat water whats that other way pound them on a rock the way it shows in national geographic i dont believe it we were in bed by sundown gays doors lockedpitch dark in minutes according to deety and gay sunrise was ten hours and fortythree minutes away deety please tell gay to wake us at sunrise aye aye captain auntie zebbie you told us that the air in the car was good for about four hours in space the scoops are open now but do you get air back there should the bulkhead door be open oh top scoop serves this space the cabin is ventilated by the chin scoop scoops stay open unless internal pressure closes them can anything get in through them snakes or such hilda my dear you worry too much my very own darling copilot will you please pipe down while im speaking to the chief pilot there are many things about this car that i do not know yet i am responsible zebbie answered each scoo has a grid inside and a fine screen at the inner end nothing can get in have to clean em occasionally remind me deety ill tell gay she didand almost at once there was a crash of metal i sat up abruptly whats that hilda i am afraid that i have kicked over the supper dishes my husband added zeb how do i find the cabin light no no jacob dont try to find it no light at all until sunrise dont fret about dishes but what happened i thought they were under the instrument board i couldnt quite reach with this bed made up but the carton that supports my feet sticks out beyond the seat cushion on it so i stacked them there no harm done we can expect bobbles as we shake down i suppose so we can cope jacob that was an excellent dinner deety called out good night chatterboxes we want to sleep she closed the bulkhead door dogged it xxiii the farce is over jake for me the best soporific is to hold hilda in my arms i slept ten hours i might have slept longer had i not been blasted by a bugle call reveille i thought i was back in basic tried to rouse out fastbanged my head that slowed me i reoriented saw my lovely bride beside me yawning prettily realized that we were on mars mars not even our own mars but another universe that hateful tune started to repeat louder i banged on the bulkhead how do you shut this thing off shortly i saw dogs of the bulkhead door turning then the door swungas the call went into its third time around still louder zeb showed blinking do you have a problem  i couldnt hear but i could piece out what he meant how do you shut off this racket no problem i think thats what he said good morning gay the bugle faded into the distance good morning boss im awake ah but will you stay awake i wont go back to bed promise ive dealt with your sort before me bucko if you arent out of here before my landlady wakes up ill lose this room then another hassle with the cops its not worth it you cheapskate youre a smart girl gay so smart im looking for another job back to sleep gay over roger and out bossand blessed silence i said to my daughter deety how could you do this to us her husband answered deety didnt jake she was told to place a call for sunrise but didnt know what a morning call means to gay i grumped and opened the starboard door hildas rearrangements had given me the best rest i had had in days but two double beds in a sports car left no room on arising to do anything but get out so i slid out the door groped for the step paused to ask hilda for shoes and coverallcaught sight of something and said quietly hilda my rifle quickly my little treasure is always reliable in emergency her clowning is simply persona a most pleasant one the worst aspect of the jest of making her captain was that she lost her smilei hoped that zeb would soon resume command we had needed the lessonbut no need to go on i digress i asked for my rifle she whispered roger and had it in my hand at once with the quiet report locked one in the chamber waitim getting zeb that made sense by staying on the step in the corner formed by door and car my rear was safe and i need cover only a small sector i prefer a bolt actioncorrection i have a boltaction rifle i inherited from my fathers eldest brother who had liberated it on leaving the marine corps i unlocked it opened the bolt slightly saw that a cartridge was in the chamber closed the bolt left the piece unlocked zeb said at my ear softly whats the excitement over there i pulled my head out of the way saw hilda and deety almost on top of zebhilda with deetys shotgun deety with her husbands police special zeb said pixies they may still be around lets check cover me from here no zeb you to the right me to the left we check the port side meet
