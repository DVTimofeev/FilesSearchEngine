contained iugs  lars so i told gay to take us home i was afraid they might catch us embarrassing deety said zebadiahi mean captainembarrassing how sir oh that missing letter in the alphabet scared me but it no longer does now im nervous about aliens black hats deety you were lucky that first time because deetyprime was not at home but she may be tonight possibly in bed with her husband named zebadiahprime unstable cuss likely to shoot at a strange car shining lights into his fatherinlaws garage a violent character youre teasing me no princess it did worry me a parallel space with so small a difference as the lack of one unnecessary letter but with house and grounds you mistook for your own seems to imply a father and daughter named iacob and deiah thoris captain zebbie pronounced the names yacob and deyah thoris zebadiah that scares me almost as much as aliens aliens scare me far more hello gay howdy zeb your nose is runny smart girl one gee vertically to one klick hover roger dodger you old codger we rested on our backs and head rests for a few moments then with the stomachsurging swoosh of a fast lift we leveled off and hovered zebbie said deety can the autopilot accept a change in that homing program by voice or does it take an offset in the verniers what do you want to do same ellandell two klicks above ground i think so shall i or do you want to do it captain you try it deety yes sir hello gay hi deety program check define home home cancel anyall inertials transitions translations rotations return to preprogrammed zero latitude longitude ground level report present location one klick vertically above home gay program revision waiting deety home program cancel ground level substitute two klicks above ground level hovering program revision recorded gay deceiver take us home instantly with no feeling of motion we were much higher zeb said two klicks on the nose deety youre a smart girl zebadiah i bet you tell that to all the girls no just to some gay youre a smart girl then why are you shacked up with that strawberry blonde with the fat knockers zebbie craned his neck and looked at me sharpie thats your voice i ignored him with dignity zebbie drove south to the grand canyon eerie in starlight without slowing he said gay deceiver take us homeand again we were hovering over our cabin no jar no shock no nothing zebbie said jake once i figure the angles im going to quit spending money on juice how does she do it when we havent been anywhereno rotation no translation i may have given insufficient thought to a trivial root in equation ninetyseven but it is analogous to what we were considering doing with planets a fivedimensional transform simplified to three i dunno i just work here captain zebbie admitted but it looks like we will be peddling gravity and transport as well as real estate and time burroughs and company space warps unlimitedno job too large no job too small send one newdollar for our free brochure captain suggested jacob would it not be prudent to translate into another space before experimenting further the alien danger is still with us is it not zebbie sobered at once copilot you are right and it is your duty to advise me when i goof off however before we leave we have one duty we must carry out something more urgent than getting our wives to safety my jacob askedand i felt humble and proud something more urgent jake ive bounced her around not only to test but to make it hard to track us because we must break radio silence to warn our fellow humans oh yes captain my apologies sir i sometimes forget the broader picture dont we all ive wanted to run and hide ever since this rumpus started but that took preparation and the delay gave me time to think point number one we dont know how to fight these critters so we must take cover point number two we are dutybound to tell the world what we know about aliens while that little isnt muchweve stayed alive by the skin of our teethif five billion people are watching for them they can be caught i hope captain asked deety may i speak of course anyone with ideas about how to cope with these monsters must speak im sorry but i dont have such ideas you must warn the world sirof course but you wont be believed im afraid youre right deety but they dont have to believe me that monster in the garage speaks for itself im going to call rangersreal rangersto pick it up i said so that was why you told me just to leave it i thought it was lack of time both hilda we didnt have time to sack that cadaver and store it in the freezer room but if i can get rangersreal rangersto that garage before black hats get there that corpse tells its own story an undeniable alien lying in its goo on a rangers uniform that has been cut away from it not a close encounter ufo that can be explained away but a creature more startling than the duckbill platypus ever was but we have to hook it in with other factors to show them what to look for your boobytrapped car an arson case in logan professor brains convenient disappearance my cousins death in sumatraand your sixdimensional noneuclidean geometry i said excuse me gentlemen cant we move somewhere away from right over our cabin before you break silence im jumpyblack hats are hunting us youre right sharpie im about to move us the story isnt longall but the mathso i taped a summary while the rest of you were getting ready gay will speedzip it a hundred to one zebbie reached for the controls
