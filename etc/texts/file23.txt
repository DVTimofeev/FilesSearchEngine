felt might be too bawdy for jacobs innocent mindi didnt even hint how her father actually talked to me in private let us all preserve our illusions it lubricates social relations possibly deety and zebbie talked the same way to each other in privateand regarded us old folks as hopelessly square ix most males have an unhealthy tendency to obey laws deety aunt hilda and i finished reprogramming in the time it took zebadiah and pop to design and make the failsafes and other mods needed to turn gay deceiver with the timespace widget installed into a continua traveler which included placing the back seats twenty centimeters farther back for leg room after they had beeped out to place the widget abaft the bulkhead md eld it to the shell the pessing contiols and triple verniers wcic remoted to the drivers instrument boardwith one voice control for the widget all others manual if any of our voices said gay deceiver take us home car and passengers would instantly return to snug harbor i dont know but i trust my pop he brought us home safe twice doing it with no failsafes and no deadman switch the latter paralleled the take us home voice order was normally clamped closed and coveredbut could be uncovered and held in a fist closed there were other failsafes for temperature pressure air radar collision course and other dangers if we wound up inside a star or planet none of this could save us but it is easy to prove that the chances of falling downstairs and breaking your neck are enormously higher than the chance of cooccupying space with other matter in our native universespace is plentiful mass is scarce we hoped that this would be true of other universes no way ahead of time to check on the numberofthebeast spacesbut the cowards never started and the weaklings djed on the way none of us ever mentioned not trying to travel the universes besides our home planet had turned unfriendly we didnt discuss black hats but we all knew that they were still here and that we remained alive by lying doggo and letting the world think we were dead we ate breakfast better each morning after hearing gay deceiver offer null report on news retrievals zebadiah i am fairly certain had given up his cousin for dead i feel sure zebadiah would have gone to sumatra to follow a lost hope were it not that he had acquired a wife and a prospective child i missed my next period so did hilda our men toasted our notyet bulging bellies hilda and i smugly resolved to be good girls yes sirand careful hilda joined my morning toning up and the men joined us the first time they caught us at it zebadiah did not need it but seemed to enjoy it pop brought his waistline down five centimeters in one week shortly after that toast zebadiah pressuretested gay deceivers shellfour atmospheres inside her and a pressure gauge sticking out through a fitting in her shell there being little we could do while our spacetime rover was sealed we knocked off early swim anybody i asked snug harbor doesnt have a citytype pool and a mountain stream is too cooold pop had fixed that when he concealed our spring overflow was piped underground to a clump of bushes and thereby created a natural mountain rivulet that passed near the house then pop had made use of a huge fallen boulder plus biggish ones to create a pool one that filled and spilled he had done work with pigments in concrete to make this look like an accident of water flow this makes pop sound like paul bunyan pop could have built snug harbor with his own hands but spanishspeaking labor from nogales built the underground and assembled the prefab shell of the cabin an air crane fetched parts and materials from an albuquerque engineering company jane had bought for pop through a frontlawyers in dallas the companys manager drove the air crane himself having had it impressed on him that this was for a rich client of the law firm and that it would be prudent to do the job and forget it pop bossed the work in texmex with help from his secretaryme spanish being one language i had picked for my doctorate laborers and mechanics never got a chance to pinpoint where they were but they were well paid well fed comfortably housed in prefabs brought in by crane and the backbreaking labor was done by powerwho cares what locos gringos do two pilots had to know where we were building but they homed in on a radar beacon that is no longer there blokes in black hats had nothing to do with this secrecy it was jungle caution i had learned from mama never let the revenooers know anything pay cash keep your lips closed put nothing through banks that does not appear later in tax returnspay taxes greater than your apparent standard of living and declare income accordingly we had been audited three times since mama died each time the government returned a small overpayment i was building a reputation of being stupid and honest my inquiry of swim anybody was greeted with silence then pop said zeb your wife is too energetic deety later the water will be warmer and the trees will give us shade then we can walk slowly down to the pool zeb i agree jake i need to conserve ergs nap i dont have the energy to take one what were you saying this morning about reengineering the system aunt hilda looked startled i thought miss gay deceiver was already engineered are you thinking of changing everything take it easy sharpie darlin gay deceiver is finished a few things to stow that have been weighed and their moment arms calculated i could have told her in the course of figuring what could be stowed in every nook
