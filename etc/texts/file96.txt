course but it takes my voice can you figure the cancelandreset for mnemonic reasons it should be one of three probably ninetyfive on the button although i would prefer eightynine why work on it zebadiah why did you call this meeting with sharpie leaving us the matter is academic we wont be coming back to mars oh dear whats the trouble sharpie captain i promised squeaky a ride zebbie could you keep my promise for me please for old times sake captain once we lift to drop you on minusj we wont return but the captain still is captain and can give squeaky that ride in the next thirty minutes if it suits her may i offer something in my own defense pop put in of course jake sorry captain youre in charge may the copilot have the floor jacob even though i find it necessary to leave you i love and respect you and will always listen to you thanks darling thank you captain i was in that huddle because brigadier hirdjones always remembers that huddle was the top physical scientists on mars a scruffy lot but they get the technical journals and read them a few months late i was talking with the top chemist well jake make it march zeb not one knew an isotope from an antelope you cant buy juice here for that you disobeyed a direct order of the captain sharpie you should have him flogged around the fleet before you surrender office dont loke zebbie captain i am not joking jake thats no news i spotted it this afternoon sharpie deety in england i missed it aunt hilda said i dont know england well deety well maybe i admitted how demanded pop little things no roadables just horsedrawn vehicles no air traffic other than a few ornithopters coalfired steampowered trains of cars traffic on the thames what little there was minded me of pictures of victorian england daughter why didnt you mention this you saw it pop those were my reasons zebadiah agreed my hope of getting juiced here dropped to onetenth of one percent it is now zero zebadiah sighed but that isnt why i asked the captain to call us together family there are vermin here the world wobbled againand so did i aunt hilda was saying how did you learn this zebbie you gals had plenty of company and jake had the local scientists so squeaky gave me his attention captain you told us to stick to the truth yes agreed aunt hilda but not to volunteer information i didnt volunteer i was debriefed squeaky asked me about the ride we gave his boss i tried to be vague squeaky took a photo from his pocket the governor tells me this was taken this afternoon deety it was the pic you took of the thames and the tower i shortly started giving him a full account rather than have it dragged out the governor had told him the works squeaky was comparing my version with berties looking for holes in a yarn most easily explained by hypnosis delirium tremens insanity or fancy lying since no two witnesses exhibit any of these in the same way they can be used as truth tests contrariwise two witnesses who tell exactly the same story are lying i assume that bertie and i differed enough to be credible i asked my husband zebadiah did you explain sixdimensional space to him zebadiah looked pained how could i when i cant explain it to me anyhow hes looking forward eagerly to the ride captain sharpie promised him oh dear zebbie will you take a note to him captain we are not coming back after we drop you ill be breaking a date with him too either before or after whatever time suits you hes planning to give meand anyone else who wants to goa ride to see the vermin black hats fake rangers i do wish the world would not wobble pop said zeb spill it quit stalling shut up and listen squeaky showed me a scrapbook dull as a scrapbook usually is until we came across a page of black hats deety you would have been proud of me i am proud of you i answered because i didnt scream or faint i showed no special interest i just said god in heaven squeaky those are the horrors that chased us off earth youve got em here no special interest i didnt climb the drapes i merely said or have you managed to exterminate them the discussion became confused as they dont kill them they put them to work squeaky had to repress amusement at the notion that wogs could be dangerous he glanced at his watch and said come ill show you ordinarily we dont allow wogs in town but this old fellow takes care of the governors gardens and may not yet have been returned to the pens for the night he led me to a balcony squeaky looked down and said too late im afraid no there it ishooly chop chopand again i didnt faint hooly ran toward us with a gait i cant describe stopped abruptly threw an openpalm salute and held it private hooly reports squeaky let him stand there this wog he told me is the most intelligent of the herd it knows almost a hundred words can make simple sentences as intelligent as a dog and it can be trusted not to eat the flowers herbivorous says i showing off my booklarnin oh no he tells me omnivorous we hunt wild ones to provide the good wogs with a change in diet and of course when we slaughter overage wogs that provides more ration thats enough for one lesson children pleasant dreams tomorrow the brigadier will have a roadable big enough for all of us to take us out to meet the martian natives aka wogs aka black hats aka verminunless that interferes with the ride you arent
