was doing rigging it so that she could have a quiet hour in which to get acquainted with maureen i didnt resent it i would have rigged it for me had i been able i curved down the corridor whistled for lib to let me in stopped dead and whistled another sort of whistle she was dressed if dressed is the word wheeeewhoo like it i cant wait to get into mine it is the most indecent outfit ive ever seen with no other purpose than to excite lewd libidinous lascivious licentious lecherous lustful longings in the loins of lotharios isnt that the purpose of clothing well aside from protectionyes but im beginning to realize that a culture with no body taboo has to go much farther in styling to achieve that purpose it was a dress with a skirt that was a cm ruffle worn low the material was silky stuff in pastel green the bodice had no back but the front came clear up to the neckwith cutouts for each teat the designer did not stop there libs left teat was barebut her right one was barer pet a transparent film that clung and was covered with rainbow iridescence that moved in endless patterns with every jiggleand jiggle we do no matter how firm elizabeth is as firm as i am but hers quivered enough to swirl that iridescence just from breathing whew if both had been bare or both iridescent it would not have done a quarter as much it was the contrast that would make em howl at the moon my dress was exactly like hers save that my right teat was the bare one lib got me into it then i hurried to the bridge with a hopepromise to be back ten minutes before the hour to have her touch up my eyebrows and lashes im not much for cosmetics neither is she but our lashes and brows hardly show without help and this was a formal occasion one of doras blue fireflies led me to a lift that took me to the bridge where dora had told me i would find laz and lor laz spotted me first made a yelling noise while patting her lips which i took to mean enthusiasm those kids correction women close to pops age but they feel like kidslazlor are as female as i am and recognize what incites the lovely beast in men they liked my dress i liked that bridge reminded me of star trek pointed ears would not have surprised me or nichelle nichols backed by colored lights this place makes my mouth water maybe someday a guided tour pretty please captain lor said certainly but how about a swap as we havent even been inside gay deceiver and dora says she is wonderful and when this job is done and weve rescued mama maureen there wont be anything to stop us once dora is safe on the ground at tertius huh certainly i answered gleefully as now i knew that our hour absence in zero seconds had not been noticed to lor and laz the snatch was still in the planning stage apparently  buddy boy had not yet told his sisters had not yet worked up a set of lies probably that would account for his being locked in the bathroom while the rest of us did the job at the earliest opportunity i went on want to take a ride in gay oh my could we not for me to say but i can tell you what works cuddle up to the commodore pet her be sweet to her ask her if she will let you call her aunt hilda when youre off duty that will please her shes a cat pet her and respect her feelings and she purrspush her and she scratches they glanced at each other we will thanks de nada chicas youve learned galacta in chorus what no probably a phrase that carried over but i was sent here on duty and ive been chatting instead commodores compliments to the captain and the commodore requests that captain lorelei lee long and first officer lapis lazuli long join her at dinner at twenty oclock and as a favor to the commodore please dress in the same fashion as doctors libby and deety and thats me and im wearing the fashion you are to wear captain lor answered certainly well be there we never miss dinner and always dress formally and i dont mean bare skin skin is for working or sleeping but we treat dinner in the dora as a formal party and that calls for the works formal evening dress and jewelry and cosmetics and perfume and we are about to bathe and change but we cant dress the way you are because our dresses are already picked out and its too late to start over i said look chums you brought this on yourselves by urging lib and me to dress this way neither of us was enthusiastic but we promised the commodore learned what libby and i expected to wear and decided that four of us all about the same size and coloration would look wonderful in matching green dresses so lib and i are to be opposite you two balancing you and the men are required to wear uniforms so as not to compete with us four all clear they got their stupid look which actually is a cover for stubborn determination lor said the captain sends her respects to the commodore and regrets hold it does this ship have a lifeboat yes answered lor but but you are master of this ship yes i know and im gifted with second sight i see only two viable futures for you did you get your pirate flag up in the lounge yes we did but if youll tell me what lifeboat and where ill get the flag to you before twenty i see you starting out
