that i love you for your brain not those irrelevant physical attributes zebadiah once ive had a bath you may change your mind ive had a sudden attack of brain fever you had better program her yourself mutiny again i retract and apologize you smell yummy and should marinate another week its not your cortex or your character i love but your carcassdelectable if it werent for these seat belts it would be rape rape rape all the way to the ground actually youre sort o stupidbut what a chassis thats better although im not stupid you married me res ipsa loquitur jake are you spotting anything dry hills captain might as well move on zebadiah will you place her in glide and hold a few minutes sure see something you want to check no sir but when we emerged here we had seventythree seconds to impact weve used twentyone seconds id like a few moments to insert those preprograms i overrode manually and started gay into a stretched glide while i extended her wings then i let deety and gay talk to each other deety had both changes fully worked out not once did gay answer null program i was about to warn deety that gay was not a sailplane when she reported all done captain for the s program i added in an alarm for two klicks haboveg good idea so now i head west again and give her that s code wordno execute yessir cept id like to try the revised b u g  u t program it has been less than four minutes since we left someone may be in that exact spot deety i share your curiosity but its like testing a parachute the hard way cant we save it until we need it then if there is a glitch well be dead so fast well hardly notice it deety said nothing i waited then said comment please no comment captain deetys answer was toneless hmm science officeromment please i have no comment to offer captain a slight chill copilot i require your advice uh if the captain please am i privileged to ask for written orders well ill be dipped in gay bounce is there such a thing as a space lawyer like sea lawyer jake in general anyone save in the face of the enemy may demand written orders if hell risk his career to perpetuate evidence for the courtmartial he knows will follow did it myself once and saved my neck and cost my temporary boss fifty numbersand i wound up senior to him and he resigned but a secondincommand is in a special position it is his duty to advise his co even if the co doesnt ask for advice so i dont see how you can demand written orders on a point already one of your duties but i wont make an issue of it ill direct the astrogator to log your request then i can dictate my reply into the log then i am going to ground this gobuggy and turn command over to you maybe youll have more luck chairing this debating society than i have had i wish you luckyoull need it but captain i did not ask for written orders eh i thought back he hadnt quite it sounded as if you were about to i was stalling i must advise you to follow the prudent course unofficially i prefer to risk the test but i should not have stalled im sorry that my intransigence caused you to consider relinquishing command i didnt just consider it i have resignation effective the first time we ground youve bought it jake captain yes deety you are correct the test i suggested is useless and could be fatal i should not have asked for it im sorryir me too i felt you were being too strict with deety but you werent you were taking care of us as you always do zebbie captain zebbie of course you shouldnt make a risky test we dont need i said anyone anything to add no one spoke up so i added im heading west and did so gay deceiverbug out black sky above us that dead sea bottom far below  i remarked looks as if a russian or one of their flappy craft is in our parking spot deety your revised program worked perfectly but zebadiahwhy did you risk it she sounded terribly distressed because all of you wanted to despite what you said later because its my last chance to make such a decision i added jake im going to tilt her over grab the binox and see if you can identify where we were parked if that fire is smoking you can use it for reference but captain im not taking command i wont accept it pipe down and carry out your orders its this damned yackyack and endless argument thats giving me ulcers if you wont accept command then its up for grabs but not me oh ill pilot as the new co orders but i wont command deety how long did gay pause to make that radar check at what height haboveg was half a klick duration i dont know but i can retrieve it darlingcaptain youre not really going to quit commanding us deety i dont make threats pipe down and retrieve that duration jake what do you see ive located the fire several ornithopters are on the ground my guess places one of them about where we were parked captain i advise not dropping lower advice noted deety how about that duration i didnt know how to ask for it myself not having written the program deety retrieved it smoothly  secondscall it a fifteenth of a second radar is not instantaneous gay had to stop and sweep that spot long enough for a picture to form in her gizzards to tell her whether or not she could
