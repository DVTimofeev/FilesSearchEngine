computer artist like me and the first one to calculate the number of the beast to the last significant figure and now wed better go even though we have reserved vip seats because there is a masked knight in the first match and were pretty sure who he is and has anyone seen zebadiah im certain who he is said ginnie he brought me to life and besides hes wearing karens colors i see zeb off in the distance lazarus answered no jake denied here he comes now from over this way ishtar with him all dressed up no said jubal thats anne with him somebody is screw loose lazarus is right i know my first husband even at this distance hes just approaching those three reserved sections opposite the big screen over the bar zebadiah over here the other computer artist added and that cant be anne so it must be ishtar anne is at the field i know because larry is helping jerry run it and told me anne agreed to cloak and be the third judge when jerry told her that mr clemens had agreed bonforte sits as king although he says he doesnt know much about the kinging business and even less about jousting is it true that they are using real weapons today asked jubal and real horses agreed lazarus i was able to borrow the anheuserbusch clydesdales lazarus is this wise doctor bone is taking care of the horses if one is injured well give him the works those beautiful horses will be returned to old home terra at their proper year and second in better shape than they were with added skill its takes time to turn a clydesdale into a knights charger even though thats what they are but will they ever be happy in harness again lazarus podkayne said seriously ill speak to dr bone if a horse is unhappy we will soothe poddy youre a smart girl about average here i think but if someone is unhappy i have learned what to do i have never seen a horse but theyve lived with people so long that it cant be very different jubal sighed im glad the horses will be well taken care ofbut lazarus i meant humans isnt someone going to be hurt maybe killed most of them hurt several killed but they do it for fun those who are hurt wont stay hurt we are hardly more than a loud shout from this planets best hospital if a man loses an arm or a leg or an eye or even his balls hell have to be patient while a new part is cloned but that sort of cloning we are learning to do right at the spot of injury like a lizard or a newt faster more efficient if hes killed he has two choices be brought to life again by ishtars crew brain unlikely to be hurt their helms are the best part of their armor or they can go straight to valhalla weve arranged for bifrost to extend to this field until the end of scas part in the convention six valkyries standing by and sarge smith at the top of bifrost checking them against the roster as he musters them home lazarus grinned believe me the society is paying high for these services bond posted in advance deety wrote the contract lafe youre telling me that wagnerian valkyries are waiting to carry the slain over the rainbow into asgard jubal these amazons are not opera singers these are the real hairy sweaty mccoy remember the purpose of this convention snob the waiter appeared you wish something sir yes tell your boss that i want this tablethis table onlyto have a full view of bifrost from the field to valhalla i know its not in the clothing illusion contract but the same gear will do itnd we can settle it when we go to court later it will offset some of his lousy service git wed better all git said libby they wont hold up things for us that armor is heavy and hot deety run along ill catch up here comes my first husband lafe if they are killed how do you know which ones to send to the clinic which ones to send up the bridge jubal how would you do it sealed envelopes destroyed if a knight wins opened if he loses and there may be some surprised widows tonight unable to believe that their loving husbands elect to hunt all day then feast on barbecued boar guzzle mead and wench all night in preference to being restored to life in their respectable homes but did i tell you what a winner gets aside from applause and a chance to kneel to king john and queen penelope a paradoxs his reward a paradox no no noisy in here a pair o doxies each his reward the society got a bargain the arts are in their infancy here boondock is still so much a frontier that we have not yet developed distinguished hetaerae but some of the most celebrated hetaerae in new rome volunteered their services in exchange for transportation and the privilege of attending this convention zebadiah was struck by a guided missile female from five meters he managed to stay on his feet and took his first wife to the table sat down by hilda pinched her thigh pinched her glass drained it said youre too young to drink little girl is this your father im her son jake answered do you know hazel stone if not you should we thought we saw you coming from the other direction shouldnt drink in the daytime jake waiter your servant maam ive followed your series on d since i was a kid and im honored to meet you are you covering this for lunaya pravda heavens no locus has an exclusive under the reasonable theory that locus alone is competent to report this convention
