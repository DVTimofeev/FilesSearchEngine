master poe the purloined letter method you called it lazarus stopped short if i understand you im looking at your holdout this instant but cant see it into her off ear athene whispered dont give him any more hints lazarus isnt as stupid as he looks and neither is fatso minerva subvocalized okay sis and said aloud i find no fault with your logic sir would you like another candy bar fortunately the subject was changed by one of athenes extensions handing to lazarus printouts revised programs for each and a fresh report for lazarus on his star guests they continued walking through the east peristyle of the new wing while reading lazarus asked teena anything new on isaac robert or arthur negative zero nix damn let me know soonest jubal heres an odd one a doctors degree was not a requirement for the limited listmany thousands but nevertheless most strictly limitedof people invited to subscribe to this convention but most do have a doctors degree or their cultural equivalent or

until jakes geewhizzer opened the other universes to us you for example and you sir lafe i considered you to be a spectacularly unlikely piece of fiction until i received your invitation it took some extraordinary convincing even then by your courierecause it meant missing an important date who was my courier undine you never stood a chance two bits to a lead nickel she sold it to gillian and dawn then all of your staff before she seduced you what was this date i caused you to miss harshaw looked embarrassed under the rose under the no jubal i promise to keep secrets only through evil motives my own if you dont wish to tell me then dont tell me eh damn it remember if possible that i prefer not to have it discussedhen do as you bloody please you will anyhowi always have lafe when i turned fifty i made myself a solemn vow that if i held together that long i would close shop the day i turned one hundred i had made all rational preparations to do so including distributing my worldly goods without allowing any of it to reach the sticky fingers of publicans when your invitation arrived five days before my hundredth birthday harshaw looked sheepish so here i am senile obviously even though i arranged years back for other physicians expert gerontologists to check me regularly with the idea of closing shop sooner if indicated jubal if you have not consulted ishtar then you have not yet consulted a gerontologist thats right agreed athene ish can turn your clock back and make you so young and horny youll stand on your hands to pee athene lazarus said sternly repeat aloud your program on private conversations grandfather i was on duty as secretary to your star guest when i was forced to interrupt to deliver a oneline messageinterruption necessary because it was addressed to

saying she cant help it sir a large computer with extensions widespread cant be perfectly shielded from brain waves in selfprotection to avoid confusion she must sort them out after a few quadrillion nanoseconds she finds herself reading them like large print the way a baby learns a language from hearing it lazarus said stiffly doctor harshaw i did not suspect that i was exposing you to this i
