this distance this time i didnt even try to keep still zebadiahs surprise that hilda knew anything about astronomy caused me pique our height above surface is one hundred four thousand six hundred and seventytwo kilometers plus or minus the error of the data supplied that assumes that mars is spherical and ignores the edge effect or horizon bulgeegligible for the quality of your data zebadiah answered so gently that i was sorry that i had shown off thank you deety would you care to calculate the time to fall to surface from rest at this point thats an unsmooth integral sir i can approximate it but gay can do it faster and more accurately why not ask her but it will be many hours i had hoped to take a better look jake gay has enough juice to put us into a tight orbit i think but i dont know where or when ill be able to juice her again if we simply fall the air will get stale and well need the panic buttonor some maneuverwithout ever seeing the surface close up captain would it suit you to read the diameter again i dont think weve simply been falling pop and zebadiah got busy again i let them alone and they ran even the simplest computations through gay presently pop said over twentyfour kilometers per second captain at that rate well be there in a little over an hour except that well scram before that but ladies youll get your closer look dead sea bottoms and green giants if any zebadiah twentyfour kilometers per second is mars orbital speed my father answered eh why so it is he looked very puzzled then said captaini confess to a foolish mistake not one that will keep us from getting home i hope no sir im still learning what our continua craft can do captain we did not aim for mars i know i was chicken no sir you were properly cautious we aimed for a specific point in empty space we transited to that point but not with mars proper motion with that of the solar system yes with earths motions subtracted that is in the program but we are a short distance ahead of mars in its orbit so it is rushing toward us does that mean we can never land on any planet but earth not at all any vector can be included in the programeither before or after transition translation or rotation any subsequent change in motion is taken into account by the inertial integrator but i am learning that we still have things to learn jake that is true even of a bicycle quit worrying and enjoy the ride brother what a view jake that doesnt look like the photographs the mars expedition brought back of course not said aunt hilda i said it was barsoom i kept my mouth shut ever since dr sagans photographs anyone who reads the national geographicor anythingknows what mars looks like but when it involves changing male minds it is better to let men reach their own decisions they become somewhat less pigheaded that planet rushing toward us was not the mars of our native sky white clouds at the caps big green areas that had to be forest or crops one deep blue area that almost certainly was waterall this against ruddy shades that dominated much of the planet what was lacking were the rugged mountains and craters and canyons of our planet mars there were mountainsbut nothing like the devils junkyard known to science i heard zebadiah say copilot are you certain you took us to mars captain i took us to marsten via plus on tau axis either that or im a patient in a locked ward take it easy jake it doesnt resemble mars as much as earthten resembles earth uh may i point out that we saw just a bit of earthten on a moonless night meaning we didnt see it conceded aunt hilda said i told you it was barsoom you wouldnt listen hilda i apologize barsoom copilot log it new planet barsoom named by right of discovery by hilda corners burroughs science officer of continua craft gay deceiver well all witness z j carter commandingjacob j burroughs chief officerd t b carter uh astrogator ill send certified copies to harvard observatory as soon as possible im not astrogator zebadiah mutiny who reprogrammed this cloud buster into a continua craft im pilot until i can train all of you in gays little quirks jake is copilot until he can train more copilots in setting the verniers you are astrogator because nobody else can acquire your special knowledge of programming and skill at calculation none of your lip young woman and dont fight the law of space sharpie is chief of science because of her breadth of knowledge she not only recognized a new planet as not being mars quicker than anyone else but carved up that doublejoined alien with the skill of a born butcher right jake sure thing agreed pop capn zebbie aunt hilda drawled im science officer if you say so but i had better be ships cook too and cabin boy certainly we all have to wear more than one hat log it copilot heres to our jolly cabin girl the plucky little nipper dont finish it zebbie aunt hilda cut in i dont like the way the plot develops she carves fake ranger dubs planet stranger and dazzles crew and skipper aunt hilda looked thoughtful thats not the classic version i like the sentiment better though the scansion limps sharpie darling you are a floccinaucinihilipilificatrix is that a compliment certainly means youre so sharp you spot the slightest flaw i kept quiet it was possible that zebadiah meant it as a compliment just barely maybe id better check it in a dictionary by all means dearafter you are off watch i dismissed the matter merriam microfilm was all we had
