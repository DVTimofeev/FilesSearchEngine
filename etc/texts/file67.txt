any time and one must be armedthe other rifle and pistol must guard gay i blurted out that order when the truth landed on me like a load of bricks that i the runt who had never grown up was now responsible for the lives of four people at the time my orders seemed not only logical but necessary and feasible jacob would guard me zebbie would guard deety our men would guard each other there was a flaw i did not realize that my edict required a one rifleman always to be at the car b both men to be away from the car from time to time since this is not possible i amended it when the men had to answer calls of nature we women would lock ourselves in i didnt know that this planet had anything more dangerous than alices breadandbutter fly but that was the point i didnt know and until i did i must assume that something as dangerous as a tiger lurked behind every bush heavens the bush might be carnivorous i was learning with breathsnatching speed something that most people never learn a commanding officers unlimited authority isnt freedom its a straitjacket she cant do as she pleases she never canbecause every minute awake and asleep she must protect those under her command she cant take any avoidable risk herself her life does not belong to her it belongs to her command when the captaincy was thrust on me i decided that we would stay where we were until gay deceiver was reorganized so that all four of us could sleep comfortably and safelyno swollen ankles sharpie hadnt thought of this captain hilda burroughs thought of it at once captain zebbie had thought of it when we first grounded then had let himself be overruled i knew that i could rearrange the car to let us all sleep behind locked doors but it would take time sweat and muscles and i had just proclaimed an order that would take one or both sets of big muscles off the job for how many times a day four people such needs cant be hurried i had a horrid suspicion that having someone standing over you with a rifle even your nearest and dearest might cause a healthy reflex to fail what to do cancel the order no cancel if a better scheme turned up but dont cancel without finding some thing better this was a pretty spot but there still might be that banth or bandersnatch or boojum especially a boojum what if zebbie should wander off that distance dictated by modesty andor relaxation of nervesnd softly and silently vanish away and it was zebbie i was having trouble wit hzebbie who wasnt going to give the new captain any back talk whatsoever capn hilda honey i dont need a chaperon honest ill carry my rifle and guard myself no problem safety off and a cartridge under the firing pin promise zebbie i am not asking you i am telling you but i dont like to leave you girls unguarded chief pilot maam captain i am not a girl i am eleven years your senior i simply meant pipe down the poor dears ears turned red but he shut up i said astrogator huh yes captain auntie can you use a rifle oh sure pop made me learn but i dont like a rifle i like my shotgun take the chief pilots rifle and guard the camp look i can do it better with my shotgun pipe down and carry out your orders deety looked startled trotted over to zebbie who surrendered his rifle without comment face frozen copilot i said to my husband arm yourself with rifle and pistol go with the chief pilot guard him while he does what he has to do zebbie swallowed sharpiei mean captain sharpie it wont be necessary the golden moment has passed all this talk chief pilot please refrain from using my nickname while i am your commanding officer copilot carry out your orders remain with the chief pilot and guard him continuously as long as necessary to accomplish the purpose of the trip if zebbie meant constipationan emotional todo can have that effecti would act later in my capacity as medical officerand it would not take four husky orderlies to make zebbie hold still the authority of a commanding officer almost never requires force odd but truei wondered how i knew that once our men were out of earshot i said deety could i learn to shoot that rifle im not sure im speaking to you you humiliated my husband when we all owe him so much astrogator deetys eyes got wide good godits gone to your head astrogator uh yes captain you will refrain from personal remarks to me or about me during my tenure as commanding officer acknowledge that order then log it deetys face assumed the expression that means that she has shut out the world aye aye captain gay deceiver hello deety log mode the captain has ordered the astrogator to refrain from personal remarks to her or about her during her tenure as commanding officer i acknowledge receipt of order and will comply log date time and bingo code i tell you three times deety i hear you three times back to sleep gay roger and out deety turned to me face and voice normal again captain i can teach you to shoot in such a way that you wont get a sore shoulder or be knocked down but to become a good shot with a rifle takes a long time my shotgun doesnt kick as hard and you wont need skill i thought a shotgun was more difficult depends a shotgun is usually for surprise targets in the air that takes skill but for a stationary targetwithin rangeits about like a garden hose the shot spreads in a cone so easy that its not sporting not sporting suits me
