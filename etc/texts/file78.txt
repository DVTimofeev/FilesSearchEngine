sad i hate to cut our last link with home it neednt be cut i said just stretched put it back into long form and add execute deety answered captain i will do as you say but we might be a billion klicks from nowhere and hit by a meteor if anyone can gasp gayhome then we are two klicks over our cabin site in air not vacuum even if weve passed out gay wont crash us shes built not to if im gasping my last i dont want to have to say gay deceiver take us home execute thats ten syllables against two with air whooshing out i said that settles it the gay home program stands unless my successor changes it youre not talking to me captain sharpie darlingi mean captain hildabecause im not your successor but deety convinced me i will not admit that those vermin have run me permanently off my own planet at least i can return to it to die son lets not speak of dying we are going to stay alive and raise kids and enjoy it thats my pop say doesnt anybody want to see this picture we made it a rest stop worrying more about giant termites than about bushes and jacob found a can opener the can opener i put a stop to an attempt to fix the blame advice to all explorers do not roam the universes without a spare can opener then it was prepare for lift and a new program chief pilot switch on autopilot gay deceiver explore true bearing twosixfive unit jump five minima use bingo stop continue end program short of sunrise line ground acknowledge by paraphrase explore west five degrees south fiftyklick units twosecond check each jump ground myself no power greenwich time ohthreeseventeen deety is that time right for that program gay deceiver program revision cancel grounding from program coded a tramp abroad display locus display bingoes she displayed mars at once but gibbous i scrawled a note to deety how do i rotate to show day side only dear deety she wrote her answer passed it overi doubt that our men saw it program revision display locus realtime day side gay accommodated it took several steps to define new locus as sunset line right edge  east to sunrise line left edge  west and between  and  some russian area had been close to  so i widened the searchthen let the locus move with the terminators gay can see in the dark but i cant i told her to end explore at greenwich ohthreeseventeen and start a tramp abroad continue until directed otherwise and had gay repeat back in her phrasing i touched zebbies shoulder pointed to the switch that cut out gays ears drew a finger across my throat he nodded and shut her out i said questions gentlemen deety i do captain said our chief pilot do you plan on sleeping tonight certainly zebbie an ideal sleeping spot would be one far from the russians but close to the present sunset line or did you want to work all night if you wish i noticed that you gave gay a program that could keep her going for days or weeksand that you had reduced haboveg to six klicks breathable air by rotating duties with one or two always stretched out aft we can stay up a week easily and still give jakes ankles a break i can skip a nights sleep said deety captain auntie honey with enough random samples and a defined locus sampling soon approaches a grid a fly couldnt get through do you want the formula heavens no as long as it works it works lets make a long run get a big sampling but id like to add something lets parallel the display onto a sidelooker screen and light every vertexwhile the main display shows bingoes youll see how tight a screen youre building sharpie dont let her do it zebbie added scuse please captain the astrogator is correct on software but i know more about this hardware you can crowd a computer into a nervous breakdown i have safeguards around smart girl if i give her too much to do she tells me to go to hell but she likes deety like a willing horse shell try hard for deety even when its too much deety said soberly captain i gave you bad advice her husband said dont be so humble deety youre smarter than i am and we all know it but we are dependent on smart girl and cant let her break down captain i dont know how much strain the timespace twister puts on her but she has unnecessary programs at the captains convenience i would like to review everything in her perms and wipe those we can do without my very early convenience sir is the schedule okay oh sure just dont add that side display thank you chief pilot anyone else copilot my dear my dear captain is there some reason to find a spot near the sunset line if you intend to work all night oh but jacob i do not plan to work all night it is now about twenty hundred by our personal circadians as established by when we got up i think we can search for three to four hours i hope that we can find a spot to sleep near the sunset line scout it in daylight let gay land herself on it for her permsthen return to it in the dark when we get tired i see in part my dear unless i misunderstood you you are heading west but you said that you wanted to find us a place to sleep near the presert sunset line east or did i misunderstood you its very simply explained jacob yes dear captain i made a horrible mistake in navigation chief pilot did you spot it yup yes captain why didnt you speak
