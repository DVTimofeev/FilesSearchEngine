parked youre certain yessir the colonels scoutabout is stifl burning there are peope near it nowhere ese thats why im certain there is no one where we were b u g  u t is safe zebbie was slow to answer how about it folks it woud be an unnecessary risk just one squawk and ill skip it i kept quiet and hoped the others would too i dont worry im going to live as tong as atropos permitsmeanwhile i intend to enjoy every minute zebbie waited then said here we go gaybug out xx right theory wrong universe zeb deety is going to force me to look like a hero because i dont have the guts to let her down i thought my copilot would veto going back to the scene of the crime jake is levelheaded about safety precautions i didnt count on sharpie shes unpredictable but i thought jake would object he didnt i waited until i was certain that no one was going to get me off the spot then waited some more then said sadly here we go and told gay to bug out i expected to be a mushroom cloud instead we were parked where we had been and the colonels craft was burning briskly someday i am going to run that experiment a transition to attempt to cause two masses to occupy the same space but i wont be part of the experiment the bugout program scared me and i liked the takeushome program a lot better after we made it two klicks haboveg instead of parked could the bugout program be modified so that gay sneaked up on her target checked it by radar before accepting it take it up with deety zebstick to what you know the russians appeared to be slow to notice our return one ornithopter had grounded not far from the fire there were several bystanders i could not see whether or not my erstwhile arresting officer colonel somethingsky was in the group i assumed that he was then i was sure a figure broke loose and headed toward us waving a pistol i said briskly shipmates is there any reason to hang around i waited a short beat hearing no objectiongay bounce that black sky looked good i wondered how bumpsky was going to explain to the grand duke brass hats are notoriously reluctant to believe unlikely stories did i bounce too quickly have you all seen what you wanted to see only deety answered i was checking that program i think i see a way to avoid two masses conflicting keep talking gay could sneak up on the target inspect it by radar accept it and ground or refuse it and bouncewith no loss of time and with the same execute code that spot could be kneedeep in russians and gay would simply whoosh us to where we are now i said to leave it to deety you heard me good idea do it cant have too many failsafes ill reprogram when we stop correction i want that failsafe programmed now i might need your revised program any moment aye aye captain captain darling if you please if you must call me captain then review all preprograms and debug them if necessary with analogous failsafes and any new ones in the future now just put her into glide headed west and transit three minima or more or less i thought that a spot check every thirty kilometers would be about right for a rapid survey what altitude will we wind up assuming i simply aim her at the horizon and transit tangent to the curve oh what altitude do you want captaincaptain darling a tangent does little in three minima just a touch over a hundred meters is ten kilometers about right ten klicks is fine i could aim at the horizon make transition then at once give the b  u n c e order so you could zebadiah but if you will use the horizon as reference and aim eighteen and a half degrees above it will your gunsight depress that far no but ill tell gay no problem three minima on that upward slant will place you ten klicks haboveg and a couple of klicks short of three minima on the curve plus my present altitude no no visualize the triangle zebadiah it makes no real difference whether you do this from ten klicks haboveg or parked on the ground do you want exact figures you visualize triangles deety thats your department ive got air bite now im going to head west i want to see where those ornithopters came from meantime work out that new failsafe did it really make no difference whether i started from ten thousand meters or right on deck didnt i have to add in no of course notut one way was sine and the other way was tan but which one hell it didnt matter deety was right she always is on figuresbut someday im going to work it carefully on paper with diagrams and tables copilot captain l axis transit three minima transition l axis thirty kilometersset gay deceiver im not at home but you may record a message change attitude to climb eighteen point five degrees and report roger wilco climbing ten twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen mark execute we were somewhere else with black sky gay vertical dive execute no trouble clyde enjoy the ride zebadiah may i talk with gay while you look over the terrain to reprogram that failsafe sure go ahead jake want to scan with binox while i eyeball it ill warn before transition zebadiah i could give her a scouting program automatic skip the verfliers skip the climb order just an execute code word place her on course or i could include course ill head her manually the rest is swellafter that failsafe whats the code word scout good include the execute idea in the code word deety ive decided
