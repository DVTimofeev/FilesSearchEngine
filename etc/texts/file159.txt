she wasnt concerned with the ships vector she would return the instant she left i turned to commodorenowcaptain sharpie ready for space captain thank you astrogator gay deceiver beulahland execute gay deceiver open your doors all hands unbelt disembark gay its sleepy time over goodnight hilda roger and out our passengers were dazedthey all are first time they stood outside our barn looking at the setting sun acting like zombies until i shooed them inside although beulahland does not have body taboos they wear clothes most of the time and six naked people outdoors in a clump as the chill of the evening was coming on was odd i like a low profile once inside libby said feels like arkansaw lazarus replied feels like mizzoura neither i told them it would be the st ate of vah i nton if it werent beulahiand and what ought to be puget sound is about a kilometer over that way it still feels like home lazarus im happy here at that moment i decided we would never give up new harbor apparently we were going to be citizens of tertius or maybe new rome on secundus or both commuting is no problem when lightyears mean nothing on another time axis we could take a rest from city life anytime and have it cost not one days work on tertius contrariwise only such time would pass on new world as we spent there hmm maybe we could sell vacations or extra study time for that student who has his big exam the one he must pass tomorrow morning sell him room and board and transportation and three weeks not in the calendar at a slight markup of course i built a cheerful fire in the fireplace and lazarus washed dishes while libby insisted on proving that she could cook on a wood range even though she had learned centuries ago by her time scale as a gangling boy yes elizabeth can cook we ate and sat around and ta ked puizio ho ia ba ui a at laureen not make that one tiny mista ke it was then thai deetv bliught up the root ter of the dead body ouve seen how ocr urate day can be but icnr do we get a freshlydead corpse to replace maureen lazarus told her to forget it i provide the corpse thats not a good answer lazarus deety dont worry itll be dead and i will dump it i said lazarus i dont like that answer a damn bit nor do i jake seconded nor i agreed sharpie woodie youre asking us to make a snatcha hanging offense many places bad trouble anywhere we dont mind the technicality saving an old womans life isnt the sin kidnapping is but what about this freshlydead corpse we dont deal in murder lazarus glowered libby said hastily if i assure you that it is all right will you let it go at that no pronounced sharpie woodie must come clean all right all right i own this corpse no murder or any other crime involved now will you quit riding me about it jake i dont like it zeb i dont either but we neednt do anything we go limp he may not last long in a culture that balances possible but thats his problem sharpie said quickly did either of you promise him a ride back to my ship whose ship mv ship woodie gentlemen i didnt promise him did you jake no did you deety hilda not me pop nor me jacob woodie earlier today i thought you had seen the light conceded i am but indifferent honest myself but even pirates need to feel safe with their shipmates you and i shook hands as partners you dont seem to understand what that means however im not going to abandon you here youd be balanced in a week dead or worse so well take you back by the way it is impossible to steal gay deceiver yes i know you once stole a ship enormously bigger than gay but not as well protected lazarus tell them lib i was waiting for the commodore to finish that corpse wasnt murdered because it was never alive other than as a vegetable lazarus looked embarrassed about thirty years ago we started a medical school on tertius a onehorse deal more of a branch of the clinic but genetic engineering is taught and student genetic surgeons must practice ordinarily a clone that goes bad is fled and frozen and its tissues studied a clone that takesshows no fault deviationis either cared foi and allowed to develop if its genetic source rots a spare body and will pay for it or more likely a healthy clone is auiel a laboratory exercise an ethical medical school requires supervised destruction during the first pseudo trimester befoie quickening shows in the ave form neither student nor tissue donor is likely to be upset by this quasiabortion as the student is almost always herself the donorif it bothers her shes in the wrong vocation if the student is not the donor emotional upset is hardly possible the student thinks of the clone as a quasiliving histological specimen the usefulness of which is at endand the tissue donor cant be upset being unaware of it why so lazarus if anybody is tinkering with my cells i want to know about it i do deety that tissue may be years even centuries old the donor may be parsecs away or still warm and the donor just leaving the building or anything in between a spermandova bank insures the future of the race a tissue bank insures the future of the individual but somebody has to pick up the check its a tanstaafl situation a few of the very wealthyand neurotic always have a quickened but unawakened clone in stasis im wealthy but not neurotic i dont have a reserve clone i caught sight of libbys face as lazarus made
