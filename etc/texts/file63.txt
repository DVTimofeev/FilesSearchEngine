circle  debating society we were all intensely interested as we were all in the same peril but how much tougher is it to be captain rather than one of the crew twice ten times i didnt know was my husband cracking under the pressure getting ulcers was i adding to his burden i didnt have to stop to think this through it was preprogrammed below the conscious level pop pushed the execute button and the answers spilled out i answered my husband at once what hypocritical question sir you said hypothetical something about computers and cooking captain my mind has gone blank perhaps we had better get on with the job before i forget how it works deety you wouldnt fib to your pool old brokendown husband when my husband is pow and old md brokendown i will not fib to him hmm if i hadnt already promised my support to hilda i would vote for you for captain aunt hilda cut in zebbie i release you im not a candidate no sharpie once having promised political support an honorable man never welches so its all right for gay to listen in certainly sir for display i must have her hello gay hi deety display dayside globe at once gays largest screen showed the western hemisphere of earth our earth in our universeterra early afternoon at snug harbor yes the clock in my head said so and gmt on the instrument board read  good heavens it had been only twenty hours since my husband and my father had killed the fake ranger how can a lifetime be crowded into less than a day despite the clock in my head it seemed years since i had walked down to our pool a touch tiddly and hanging onto my bridegroom for support display meridians parallels subtract geographical features gay did so from program coded a tramp abroad display locus gay used orthographic projection so the  parallels were straight lines ace i had told her to display davside these two bright lines ran to the left edge of the display that being the sunrise line but the right edge of the locus was an irregular line running southwest add display russian valley to the right of the locus and touching it gay displayed as solid brightness a very long and quite wide blotch subtract russian valley the area we had sketchily explored disappeared deety my husband asked how is gay doing this her perms have no reference points for marsnot even mars of our own universe oh gay display touchdown null program mmm yes thats right the sun has just set where we were parked zebadiah shall i have her rotate the globe enough to show it all she would show would be a bright spot almost on the equator i have defined the spot where we grounded as zero meridiangreenwich for mars this mars and zero parallel an arbitrary equator oh no no while we slept gay adjusted her gyrocompass to match this planet which gave her true north and latitude she already knows the radius and curvature of marsi started to tell her and found she had retrieved it from her perms aerospace almanac i suppose so but we discussed mars diameter last night while gay was awake both you and hilda knew it jake and i did not as i remembered it aunt hilda spoke upthen pop kept quiet if pop wanted to sit back and be proud of aunt hildas encyclopedic memory that was all right with me if my husband has a flaw it is that he has trouble believing that females have brains probably because he is so intensely interested in the other end i went on with my lecture once i start gay she will say and record nothing unless ordered she will make random transitions inside that locus until someone yells bingo she wont slow down even then she will place a bright point on the map at that latitude and longitude record both latitude and longitude and the exact time she will display the bingo time too for one second if you want to retrieve that bingo you had better jot down that timeto the second because shell be doing twenty jumps each minute dont worry about the hour just the minute and the second oh you could still retrieve it if you had the minute right as i can ask her to run through all bingoes in a given minute cant be more than twenty and your bingo might be the only one when weve done one hour of this that map could at most have twelve hundred dots on itbut may have only a fewor none if they are clustered ill reduce the locus and well run it again if not we can sleep and eat and do it for the other day side the one twelve hours away either way gay will find the britishand well be safe i hope youre right ever heard of the opium wars deety yes captain sir every nation is capable of atrocities including our own but the british have a tradition of decent behavior no matter what blemishes there are sorry why a onehour program we may have to shorten it a decision every three seconds for sixty minutes may be too tiring if we start showing a marked hot spot sooner than that we can shorten the first run and reduce the locus well have to try it and see but i feel certain that a onehour run a short rest then another onehour run will locate the british if they are now on the day side deety what do you define as bingo anything that suggests human settlement buildings roads cultivated fields walls fences dams aircraft vehicles but it is not bingojust because it looks interesting although it might be stop whats the difference stop does not tell gay to record or to display for that you must add bingo
