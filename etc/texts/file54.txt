the optimum solution she might not be able to tell you how she did it since she wipes anything shes not told to remember i think she does ive never been certain jake and hilda had wandered off while deety and i had been talking they had turned back so we started toward them sharpie called out zebbie what happened to that hike right away i agreed jake we have about three hours we ought to be buttoned up before sundown check i agree the temperature will drop rapidly at sundown yup we cant do real exploring today so lets treat it as drill fully armed patrol formation radio discipline and always alert as if there were a black hat behind every bush no bushes objected hilda i pretended not to hear but what constitutes fully armed jake we each have rifles you have that oldstyle army automatic that will knock down anything if youre close enough buthow good a shot are you good enough how good is good enough most people are as accurate with a baseball as with a pistol skipper i wont attempt a target more than fifty meters away but if i intend to hit the target will be within range and i will hit it i opened my mouth closed it fifty meters is a long range for that weapon but hint that my fatherinlaw was boasting deety caught my hesitation zebadiahpop taught me pistol in the campus rotc range ive seen him practice bobbing targets at thirty meters i saw him miss one once jake harrumphed my daughter omitted to mention that i skip most surprise targets father most means more than fifty percent not true near enough six occasions four strings twentyeight targets on three hold it honey jake its silly to argue figures with your daughter with my police special i wont attempt anything over twenty metersexcept covering fire but i handload my ammo and pour my own dumdums the result is almost as lethal as that howitzer of yours but if it comes to trouble or hunting for meat well use rifles backed by deetys shotgun deety can you shoot throw your hat into the air i dont like the sound of that sharpie we have five firearms four people is there one that fits you capn zebbie the one time i fired a gun i went backwards the bullet went thataway and i had a sore shoulder better have me walk in front to trip land mines zebadiah she could carry my flchette gun sharpie well put you in the middle and you carry the firstaid kit youre medical officerarmed with deetys purse gun for defense jake its time we stowed these swords and quit pretending to be barsoomian warriors field boots im going to wear that same sweaty pilot suit about equivalent to jump suits you and deety worewhich i suggest you wear now we should carry water canteens and iron rations i cant think of anything that would serve as a canteen damn jake we arent doing this by the book what book demanded hilda those romances about interstellar exploration theres always a giant mother ship in orbit loaded with everything from catheters to cocacola and scouting is by landing craft in touch with the mother ship somehow we arent doing it that way all the more reason to conduct drill as realistically as possible jake or i one of us is honor bound to stay alive to take care of two women and unborn children exterminating blackhat vermin holds a poor second to that zebbie why are you staring at me i hadnt known that i was trying to figure how to dress you dear sharpie you look cute in jewelry and perfume but its not enough for a sortie in the bush take em off and put em away you too deety deety do you have another jump suit that can be pinned up or stitched up for hilda a something sure but it would take hours to do a good job my sewing kit isnt much hours will have to be another day today well make do with safety pins but take time to do a careful job of padding her feet into your stoutest shoes confound it she should have field boots sharpie remind me when we make that shopping trip to earthwithoutaj to hear is to obey exalted one is it permitted to make a parliamentary inquiry she startled me hilda what did i do to cause that frosty tone it was what you didnt do suddenly she smiled reached high and patted my cheek you mean well zebbie but you slipped while gay deceiver is on the ground were equal but youve been giving orders right and left i started to answer jake cut in hilda my love for a scouting expedition the situation becomes equivalent to a craft in motion again we require a captain sharpie turned toward her husband conceded sir but may i point out that we are not yet on that hike zebbie has consulted you he has not consulted deety and me he asked us for informationdarned seldom aside from that he has simply laid down the law what are we zebbie poor little female critters whose opinions are worthless caught with your hand in the cooky jar throw yourself on the mercy of the court sharpie youre right and im dead wrong but before you pass sentence i claim extenuating circumstances youth and inexperience plus long and faithful service you cant put in my helpful wife you can plead one or the other but not both they cant overlap sharpie stood on tiptoes and kissed my chin in zebbies case they do overlap do you still want to know what to use as water canteens certainly then why didnt you ask but i did no capn zebbie you did not ask and did not even give us time to volunteer the answer im sorry hilda too
