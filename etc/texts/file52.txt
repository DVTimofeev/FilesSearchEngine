steal clothes well go to phoenixwithoutaj tomorrowtoday we take a walk and see some of this planetyour planet and well stay on your planet until you get tired of it is that enough or must i confess putting jello into your pool when i didnt you really didnt cross my heart be darned actually i thought it was funny i wonder who did it aliens maybe they play rougher than that sharpie darling im not the only weirdo in your stablenot by dozens guess maybe zebbie will you kiss sharpie and make up on the ground under the starboard wing we found nur travel clothes and under the port wing those of our husbands zebadiah looked bemused jake i thought hilda was right it had slipped my mind that we had clothing on the wings use your head son im not sure i have one i dont understand it either darling aunt hilda added daughter pop said pop i think i know but i pass zeb the car never moved instead aunt hilda interrupted jacob are you saying that we did not go straight up we were therefive minutes ago yes my darling but we didnt move there motion has a definable meaning a duration of changing locations but no duration was involved we did not successively occupy loci between herethen and therethen aunt hilda shook her head i dont understand we went whoosh up into the sky then whoosh back where we started my darling we didnt whoosh deety dont be reticent i sighed pop im not sure there exists a symbol for the referent aunt hilda zebadiah a discontinuity the car got it said zebadiah i didnt aunt hilda persisted like this sharpie my husband went on my car is here spungit vanishes our clothes fall to the ground ten seconds laterflipwere back where we started but our clothes are on the ground get it now i i guess so yes im glad you do because i dont to me its magic zebadiah shrugged magic magic i stated is a symbol for any process not understood thats what i said deety magic jake would it have mattered if the car had been indoors wellhat fretted me the first time deety and i translated to earthwithouttheletterj so i moved our car outdoors but now i think that only the destination matters it should be emptyi think but im too timid to experiment might be interesting unmanned vehicle worthless target a small asteroid a baby sun i dont know zeb nor do i have apparatus to spare it took me three years to build this one so we wait a few years jake air has mass that worried me also but any mass other than degenerate mass is mostly empty space airearth sealevel airhas about a thousandth the density of the human body the body is mostly water and water accepts air readily i cant say that it has no effecttwice ive thought that my temperature went up a trifle at transition or translation in atmosphere but it could have been excitement ive never experienced caisson disease from it has any of us felt discomfort not me jake ive felt all right pop i agreed i got space sick till deety cured it aunt hilda added so did i my darling but that was into vacuo and could not involve the phenomenon pop i said earnestly we werent hurt we dont have to know why a basic proposition of epistemology bedrock both for the three basic statements of semantics and for information theory is that an observed fact requires no proof it simply is selfdemonstrating let philosophers worry about it they havent anything better to do suits me agreed hilda you big brains had sharpie panting i thought we were going to take a walk we are dear agreed my husband right after those steaks xviii the whole world is alive zebadiah four dagwoods later we were ready to start walkabout deety delayed by wanting to repeat her test by remote control i put my foot down no why not my captain ive taught gay a program to take her straight up ten klicks its g a y b  u n c a new fastescape with no execution word necessary then ill recall her by b u g  u t if one works via walkytalky so will the second it can save our lives it can uh i went on folding tarps and stowing my sleeping bag the female mind is too fast for me i often can reach the same conclusion a woman gets there first and never by the route i have to follow besides that deety is a genius you were saying my captain i was thinking deety do it with me aboard i wont touch the controls check pilot nothing more then it wont be a test yes it will i promise cub scout honor to let it fall sixty seconds or to three klicks haboveg whichever comes first these walkytalkies have more range than ten kilometers even between themselves gays reception is much better deety you trust machinery i dont if gay doesnt pick up your second commandsun spots interference open circuit anythingill keep her from crashing but if something else goes wrong and you did crash i would have killed you she started to cry so we compromised her way the exact test she had originally proposed i wasted juice by roading gay deceiver a hundred meters got out and we all backed off deety said into her walkytalky gay deceiver bug out its more startling to watch than it is to be inside there was gay deceiver off to our right then she was off to our left no noisenot even an implosion splat magic well deety are you satisfied yes zebadiah thank you darling but it had to be a real test you see thatdont you i agreed while harboring a suspicion that my test had been more stringent deety
