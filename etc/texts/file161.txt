a vegetable unaware she told me that her students had unknowingly provided her with dozens to work on usually they died too soon or never developed human appearance or had some other fault that made them unusable but several years ago she succeeded i testify that this thing looked like laz and lor as it passed through the stage of its forced development and also that it looked like an older version wrinkled and hair streaked with gray when it died two tertian years ago huh fresh corpse and was quickfrozen at once i testify to something else friends in becoming a woman i acquired an interest in biology that i had not had as a male while i teach math at bit i am also staff mathematician to the clinic and have studied a bit of human biology when i say that this spoiled clone was never alive in any real sense i speak as the mathematical biologist who checked its monitors records daily it always required full metabolic support we monitored everything the surprising thing is that ishtar could keep it alive long enough to let it appear to age but ishtar is very skillful libby added lazarus would not only have become upset in telling this but he could not have told it first hand as ishtar refused to permit lazarus to see this spoiled clone or any records on it a willful woman said lazarus in three seconds i could have told ish whether or not this thing looked enough like my mother to be useful instead i must depend on the opinions of people who have never laid eyes on my mother damn it i am owner of record of the clinic and chairman regent of all bit does that count with ishtar hilda my senior wife is as tough a case as you are and looks as little like it as you do so it will be interesting to see what happens when i am your junior wife sharpie answered at her pertest are you going to be my junior wife lazarus swung around and looked at her husband jake i dont think i have a vote my blood brother answered easily ill automatically be your junior wife if we are invited to join the long family which we damn well ought to be if we make this work sharpie said indignantly wait a half i put in if we are invited to join the long familya tall assumption if i ever saw onedeety would be junior not you you elderly baggage hillbilly can be junior if she wants to be i dont mind deety i said are you serious ive been trying to point out to your stepmother that you dont push your way into a family i wasnt pushing zebadiah my wife answered i want us to stay on tertius at least until we have our babies and possibly make it our home it seems to be a pleasant place and should be free of black hatsno skin taboos but that doesnt mean that the longs have to have us in their laps i intend to nominate you zebadiah libby told me all four of you and i hope you four accept but deety twin you know what im attempting with your father yes i know im cheering for it your husband must hear this deety i still have that y chromosome in every cell even though it has been so inhibited by hormone balance that i dont notice it you and i could try for a mathematicalgenius baby too huh which one of us supplies the penis ishtar does neither of us would be hostmother the way it would be done but any of my sisterwives would supply womb room if she didnt happen to be pregnant or the hostmother could be a stranger we would never meet and the childs familyparents strangers tooall handled by ishtar who always reads the relevant genetic charts before approving anything zebadiah i said without hesitation its up to you hon im in favor of it it makes sense but dont lose track of the child elizabeth i want to adopt the baby ahead of time hmm bottle baby but the formulas are probably better now not herenow tertius therethennow bottle baby oh no longer done a baby needs to suckle but there is usually spare milk around the longs if im lactating i always have excess i turn out to be a good milch cow despite that extra chromosome but deety can nurse our child if she wishes to causing a woman to come fresh with milk without bearing a child is a minor biochemical manipulation todaytertiantoday professional wet nurses do it regularly and are likely to be in that vocation because they love babies but cant have em themselves for some reason sounds good what sounded best was this a baby deety is a wonderful ideabut a baby deety who is also a baby libby is sure to be wonderful squared cubed while im on this and no one here but familyjacob there is no reason not to create a third mathematical supergenius by crossing you with your daughter i was looking at my wife thinking pleasant thoughts about baby deetylibby when elizabeth dropped this bomband deety shut down her face its not an unpleasant expression its a noexpression a closed door while deety sorts out her thoughts so i looked at jake in time to see his face shift from surprise to shock but thats incest libby supplied no jacob incest is a social matter whether you bed your daughter is none of my business im speaking of genes of still another way to conserve mathematical genius ishtar would scan your charts most carefully and would resort to chromosome surgery if there was the slightest chance of double dosage of a bad allele but you and your daughter could see ishtar on different days and never know anything about the outcome your
