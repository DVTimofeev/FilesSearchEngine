may be the first ghosts ever to search for an obstetrician in further support of my theory i am having a pregnancy with no morning sicknessa miracle that makes the land of oz as commonplace as faithful husbands i dont think i want to analyze that is that the castle of the tin woodman there in the east yes but thats the west dear deety is that sun rising or setting setting directions are reversed here everybody knows that a retrograde planet my husband commented nothing dangerous about that pop admit it you know the oz books almost as well as i do better dont give yourself airs

in the woods a hundred meters from the palace and screened from it by elms and walnut trees i had gay range it told her three times that it was a scram spotthen she landed herself slick as zebadiah i unstrapped opened the bulkhead door and crawled aft to get clean suits and thought better of it aunt hilda had followed me and headed straight for a special locker i rolled into lotus and asked
