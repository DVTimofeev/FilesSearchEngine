travel true we could go from point to point in our own or any universe in null time but how many heavenly bodies have breathable atmospheres countless billionsbut a small fraction of one percent from a practical viewpointand no publication lists their whereabouts we had no spectroscope no star catalogs no atmosphere testing equipment no radiation instruments no means of detecting dangerous organisms columbus with his cockleshells was better equipped than we none of this worried me reckless do you pause to shop for an elephant gun while an elephant is chasing you three times we had escaped death by seconds we had evaded our killers by going to earthand that safety had not lasted so again we fled like rabbits at least once every human should have to run for his life to teach him that milk does not come from supermarkets that safety does not come from p licemen that news is not something that happens to other people he might learn how his ancestors lived and that he himself is no differentin the crunch his life depends on his agility alertness and personal resourcefulness i was not distressed i felt more alive than i had felt since the death of my first wife underneath the persona each shows the world lies a being different from the masque my own persona was a professorial archetype underneath would you believe a maiden knight eager to break a lance i could have avoided military servicemarried a father protected profession but i spent three weeks in basic training sweating with the rest cursing drill instructorsand loving it then they took my rifle told me i was an officer gave me a swivel chair and a useless job i never forgave them for that hilda until we married i knew not at all i had valued her as a link to my lost love but i had thought her a lightweight a social butterfly then i found myself married to her and learned that i had unnecessarily suffered lonely years hilda was what i needed i was what she neededjane had known it and blessed us when at last we knew it but i still did not realize the diamondhard quality of my tiny darling until i saw her dissecting that pseudo ranger killing that alien was easy but what hilda didi almost lost my supper hilda is small and weak ill protect her with my life but i wont underrate her again zeb is the only one of us who looks the part of intrepid explorertall broadshouldered strongly muscled skilled with machines and with weapons and sine qua non coolheaded in crisis and gifted with the voice of command one night i had been forced to reason with my darling hilda felt that i should lead our little band i was oldest i was inventor of the timespace distorterit was all right for zeb to pilotbut i must command in her eyes zeb was somewhere between an overage adolescent and an affectionate saint bernard she pointed out that zeb claimed to be a coward by trade and did not want responsibility i told her that no born leader seeks command the mantle descends on him he wears the burden because he must hilda could not see itshe was willing to take orders from me but not from her pet youngster zebbie i had to be firm either accept zeb as commander or tomorrow zeb and i would dismount my apparatus from zebs car so that mr and mrs carter could go elsewhere where not my business or yours hilda i turned over and pretended to sleep when i heard sobs i turned again and held her but i did not budge no need to record what was said hilda promised to take any orders zeb might giveonce we left but her capitulation was merely coerced until the gory incident at the pool zebs instantaneous attack changed her attitude from then on my darling carried out zebs orders without argumentand between times kidded and ragged him as always hildas spirit wasnt broken instead she placed her indomitable spirit subject to the decisions of our captain disciplineselfdiscipline there is no other sort zeb is indeed a coward by tradehe avoids trouble whenever possible a most commendable trait in a leader if a captain worries about the safety of his command those under him need not worry barsoom continued to swell at last gays voice said ranging boss as she displayed  km

deceiver busy boss i keep forgetting that i cant ask her to display too many data at once anybody know the sea leveli mean surface atmospheric pressure of mars dont all speak at once my darling said
