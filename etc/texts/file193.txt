still happier no worries i had worries blokes with black hats and no faces but i didnt say so as deety was snuggling closer and assuring me that it was all right because aunt hilda wouldnt fib about loving pop but i should ignore that guff about her sneaking into pops bedon which i had no opinion and less interest deety where and what is snug harbor its a nowhere place a hideout land pop leased from the government when he decided to build his time twister instead of just writing equations but we may have to wait for daylight unless can gay deceiver home on a given latitude and longitude she certainly can precisely then its all right i can give it to you in degrees minutes and fractions of a second grounding gay warned us the elko county clerk did not object to getting out of bed and seemed pleased with the century note i slipped him the county judge was just as accommodating and pocketed her honorarium without glancing at it i stammered but managed to say i zebadiah john take thee dejah thoris deety went through it as solemnly and perfectly as if she had rehearsed it while hilda sniffled throughout a good thing that gay can home on a pin point i was in no shape to drive even in daylight i had her plan her route too a dogleg for minimum radar and no coverage at all for the last hundredodd kilometers to this place in the arizona strip north of the grand canyon but i had her hover before groundingi being scared silly until i was certain there was not a third fire there a cabin fireproof with underground parking for gayi relaxed we split a bottle of chablis pop seemed about to head for the basement sharpie tromped on it and deety ignored it i carried deety over the threshold into her bedroom put her gently down faced her dejah thoris yes john carter i did not have time to buy you a wedding present i need no present from my captain hear me out my princess my uncle zamir did not have as fine a collection as your father had but may i gift you with a complete set of clayton astoundings she suddenly smiled and first editions of the first six oz books quite worn but with the original color plates and a first in almost mint condition of a princess of mars the smile became a grin and she looked nine years old yes would your father accept a complete set of weird tales would he northwest smithand jirel of joiry im going to borrow them or he cant look at my oz books im stubborn i am and selfish and mean stubborn stipulated the others denied deety stuck out her tongue youll find out suddenly her face was solemn but i sorrow my prince that i have no present for my husband but you havei i do yes beautifully wrapped and making me dizzy with heavenly fragrance oh she looked solemn but serenely happy will my husband unwrap me please i did that is all anyone is ever going to know about our wedding night iv because two things equal to the same thing are never equal to each other deety i woke early as i always do at snug harbor wondered why i was ecstatically happythen remembered and turned my head my husbandhusband what a heartfilling wordmy husband was sprawled face down beside me snoring softly and drooling onto his pillow i held still thinking how beautiful he was how gently strong and gallantly tender i was tempted to wake him but i knew that my darling needed rest so i eased out of bed and snuck noiselessly into my bathour bathand quietly took care of this and that i did not risk drawing a tubalthough i needed one i have a strong body odor that calls for at least one sudsy bath a day two if i am going out that eveningand this morning i was certainly whiff as a polecat i made do with a standup bath by letting water run in a noiseless trickle into the basini would grab that proper bath after my captain was awake meanwhile i would stay downwind i pulled on briefs started to tie on a halterstopped and looked in the mirror i have a faceshaped face and a muscular body that i keep in top condition i would never reach semifinals in a beauty contest but my teats are shapely exceptionally firm stand out without sagging and look larger than they are because my waist is small for my height shoulders and hips ive known this since i was twelve from mirror and from comments by others now i was acutely aware of them from what zebadiah calls his infantile bias i was awfully glad i had them my husband liked them so much and had told me so again and again making me feel warm and tingly inside teats get in the way and i once found out painfully why amazons are alleged to have removed their starboard ones to make archery easier today i was most pleased that mama had required me to wear a bra for tennis and horseback and suchno stretch marks no coopers droop no sag and my husband called them wedding presents hooray doubtless they would become babychewed and softbut by then i planned to have zebadiah steadfastly in love with me for better reasons you hear that deety dont be stubborn dont be bossy dont be difficultand above all dont sulk mama never sulked although pop wasnt and isnt easy to live with for example he dislikes the word teat even though
