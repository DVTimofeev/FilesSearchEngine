then she kills the glim and does her act zeb there wasnt time to do it that way zeb gave a most irritating grin captain im fairly quick so is deety i said perhaps i had better check the setting zeb made no answer both women kept still i began to wonder what everyone was waiting on then realized that i was the what unbelt and check on zebs setting i remembered that irritating grin so i said deety carry out the tumbling routine the somersault completed i asked anyone see anything hilda said i think so captain could we do that again do it deety i ordered pigeontumble resumed hilda suddenly said there and deety snapped gaydeceiverstop i asked hilda do you still see it yes jacob a fuzzy star you can see it if i pull back and you lean forward i suppose we each did sofor i spotted something i see it zebthe binoculars please an invisible hand pushed them against my neck i got them lined up with difficulty got that faint light focused with great care it looks like a lenticular galaxy seen not quite edge on or it might be a family of galaxies whatever it is it is a long way off millions of lightyearsi have no way of guessing can we reach it by transition asked zeb possibly i would set middle range on six then keep punching until it showed change in width it might be possible to reach it in an hour or so do you want to look at it from your description i dont think so zeb answered that is fossil lightisnt it eh yes the light has been traveling for millions of years thats my point captain we might find that those stars had burned out fossil light doesnt tell us anything we can use lets designate this last chance and get out eminently sensible stand by to rotate copilotexecute blinding light zeb rotate execute suddenly we were in a starry void almost homelike i heaved a sigh of relief zeb what did we fall into i dont know captain he added i had my eyes closed setting the next rotation by clicks so i didnt get dazzled but i never had a chance to check my setting by eyesight either i rotated at once you got us outthanks i did get dazzled ive got purple blotches in front of my eyes new standing order at each rotation all hands close eyes and duck heads for that moment needed to be sure that we have not again run into dazzle zeb that need not slow you up since you are setting by touch and click anyhowbut if we do hit dazzle rotate us out dont wait for my orders andall handswe are all free at all times to use any of the escape programs to get us out of danger next rotation set captain thank you copilot hilda do you or deety have any notion as to what we fell into no captain my daughter answered captain jacob i have three hypotheses none worth much let others judge that my dear interior of a global star clusteror near the nucleus of a galaxy or possiblythe early part of an expanding universe when new stars are almost rubbing shoulders hmm real garden spots zeb could we have picked up excessive radiation captain the shell of this buggy is opaque to most radiation and that windscreen is heavily leadedbut no way to tell zebadiah if the film in the camera is ruined some heavy stuff got through if the next picture is okay were probably okay hilda said im glad you thought of that deety i dont like the idea of radiation while im pregnant you too hon aunt hilda were almost completely shielded where it matters it could addle our brains but not our bellies hilda do you wish to shoot one frame i asked no jacob it would waste film as you wish my eyes are coming back deety put us through one pigeontumble my daughter did so i saw nothing report hilda lots of big beautiful stars but nothing close me too popbut what a beautiful sky null report captain hilda mark it down as promising all hands stand by for fifth rotation keep eyes closed and heads down execute zeb gasped where in hell are we in hell maybe zebbie captain hilda may not be too far off i answered its something i could not have believed three weeks ago some sort of insideout universe pellucidar said deety no my dear daughter one we are not inside our home planet we are in another universe two this universe has physical laws that differ from our own the inside of a spherical shell cannot have a gravitational field by the laws of our universe yet i see a river and we seem to be falling toward it deety are we in air or in vacuo deety wiggled the controls got some air probably could get support with wings fully spread then do so deety brought the car into a deadstick glide zeb said grimly i dont want to homestead here so bigten thousand kilometers across at a guess yet its all inside no sky no horizons never again a night sprinkled with stars that light in the center looks like our sun but its too small much too small when we leave i dont want to come back the god who takes care of fools and explorers let us arrive in empty space instead of maybe ten kilometers underground but next time i hate to think about it i said it may not have been luck zeb but logical necessity huh youve lost me captain youre thinking of this as a spherical shell but there is no basis for assuming that it has an outside what endless millions of lightyears of solid rock no no nothing by nothing i do not mean space i mean a
