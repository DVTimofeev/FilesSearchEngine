and pass them around now about me i was male nearly eight hundred years then i was killed i was dead fifteen hundred years then i was revived in renewing me it was found that my twentythird gene pair was a tripletxxy the hillbilly said i see with y dominant i added twin aunt hilda is a biologist good aunt hilda may i call you that as my twin doeswill you help me with the hard parts lib smiled and it was my smilea happy grin the y was dominant but the double dose of x bothered me and i didnt know why i did well enough as a malethirty years in the space navy of old home terra as a result of an officer taking an interest in me and getting me an appointment to its academy but i lacked command temperament and spent most of my service as a staff technical officeri rarely commanded and never a large ship she grinned again but today as a selfaware female instead of a mixedup male i do not hesitate to command to go back i was never easy with boys or men shy solitary and regarded as queer not the idiom meaning homosexual i was too shy although it probably would have been good for me i was a missing howard in those daysafter the interregnumand it was years after i entered the navy that the families found me i married then into the families most xxy people are infertilei was not in the next seventy years i had twentyone children and enjoyed living with my wives enjoyed sex with them loved our children which brings us to the escape from earth led by lazarus i was a bachelor both my wives having remarried friends lazarus was the first man i ever loved lib that has nothing to do with the story i didnt know you were in love with me it has everything to do with my story off and on for eight centuries we were partners in exploration then i was killedmy own carelessness eventually lazarus and his sisters cremated me by tossing me into the atmosphere of old home terra in a trajectory that would cause ashes to impact near where i was born lazarus they dont seem surprised do they disbelieve me certainly we believe you i interrupted but what youve told us isnt news to us what we dont know is how you are now alive and female reincarnation oh no reincarnation is nonsense i found myself irritated reincarnation is something i have no opinion about since a housecleaning i gave my mind after we lost mama jane you have data i demanded deety did i step on your toes no you didnt lib i asked if you had data well no but if you assume the truth of the proposition i think i can show that it leads to a contradiction the negativeproof method its tricky lib ask georg cantor lib laughed okay i will attempt to have no opinion until someone shows me verifiable data one way or the other i was hoping you had data lib since youve been dead and i havent or dont recall having been but i dont recall being dead either just a whale of a blow in the back then dreams i cant remember then someone asking me patiently again and again whether i preferred to be a man or a woman and at last i tracked clearly enough to realize that the question was seriousnd  answered womanand they made me answer that question at least once a day for many daysand then i went to sleep one night and when i woke i was a woman which did not astonish me nearly as much as to learn that fifteen centuries had passed being a woman seemed completely natural ive had five children nowborne five i mean i had sired twentyone and one was put into me by one of my own descendants lazarus when are you going to knock me up when the greeks count time by the kalends libby honey when you want to swing thatif you arent jokingcheck with me thanks dora ill remember lazarus you will have to explain the paradox i was just a puppet isnt it bedtime were keeping our guests up captain hilda lib inquired deety is in charge of time lib i dont know ships time yet i gave you our seconds we have sixty seconds to a minute sixty minutes to an hour twentyfour hours in a day primitive eh is your time metric depends on what you mean deety you work to base ten do you not yes i mean no i work to base two because im a computer programmer but im used to convertingdont have to think about it i knew you used ten when i made a guess as to what you meant by six to the sixth power and you accepted my answer we now work to baseonehundredtwenty for most purposesbinary oneoneoneonezerozerozero fivefactorial sensible fits almost any base yes we use it for routine work but in scientific work we use basethree because our computers use trinary i understand it took gay and dora several milliseconds to interface we arent that slow my apologies dora for some work we use a time scale that fits trinary but for daily living our clock is just like yoursbut three percent slower our planets day is longer by fortytwo of your minutes youre quick deety yes your computers must be threephase ac you are quicker than i was two thousand years ago and i was quicker then no way to tell and any computer makes us look like achilles tortoise we had dinner at eighteen gay entered dora about an hour and a quarter later so for us its about half past twenty and we usually go to bed between twentytwo and twentythree if we get to bed on time which we never do what
