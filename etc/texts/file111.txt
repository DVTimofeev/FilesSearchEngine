no do it turn out your instrument lights pilots watch forward captain and astrogator will watch the sides do it execute instrument lights dimmed to zero leaving us in the darkest dark i have ever experienced i heard a repressed moan and felt a burst of sympathy for my daughter she had never liked total darkness but she carried out my orders gay deceiver tumbling pigeon forward somersaultwhee execute i felt pressure against my beltsbeing forward of the center of mass we were starting a gentle outside loop i started counting seconds as i recalled that this program took twenty seconds i had reached seventyeight seconds and was beginning to wonder when deety announced twenty seconds as the autopilot announced end of program deety said youre a smart girl gay if i were smart would i be doing this over roger and out gay captain i request permission to switch on cabin lights permission granted report observations copilot skipper i saw nothing deety nothing hilda jacob i didnt see anything cant we get out of this universe it stinks that stink is me our copilot said the reek of fear captain of what use is an empty universe zeb empty universe is a meaningless expression spacetime implies massenergy and vice versa captain it looks empty to me and to me im faced by a dilemma in theory is the mass in this spacetime so far away that we cant see it or is it in a state of cold death level entropy or did we create this universe by rotating create ithuh a possibility i pointed out if we are the only mass in this universe then this universe had no existence until we created it by rotation but it will not collapse when we rotate out because we will be leaving behind quanta we are radiating hmm captain im bothered by something else we started from universeten and made one ninetydegree rotation correct yes we rotated around x and thereby moved each of the other five axes ninety degrees we are now experiencing duration along y teh and z are spatial coordinates now and x remains spatial because we rotated on it tau and t are now null unused mmm deety what greenwich time is it zeb glanced at the instrument board uh seventeen thirteen ohnine smart girl says you are twenty seconds slow zeb looked at his navigators watch but my watch splits the difference how many minutes since we left windsor city thirtynine minutes thirteen seconds ask me a hard one im going to ask your father a hard one captain if you tell gd to scram to windsor pg right now markwhat will the greenwich time be look at your clock about a quarter past seventeen hundred but you told me that since rotating weve been experiencing duration along y axis but oh zeb im stupid no time has elapsed on t axis since the instant we rotated if we reversed the rotation we would go back to that exact instant deety hon zeb asked do you agree i felt annoyed that my soninlaw consulted my daughter as to the correctness of my professional opinionthen suppressed the thought deety will always be my little girl which makes it hard for me to remember that she is also my professional colleague my daughter suddenly looked upset i pop that first trip to the world without the letter jtime did pass it did zeb said gently but that was translation deety you continued to experience duration along t axis deety thought about it then said sorrowfully zebadiah i no longer know what time it is pop is correct we experience duration on one axis only and that is now y axis we cant experience duration on two axes at once she heaved a sigh will i ever get the clock in my head set right again sure you will my soninlaw reassured her like crossing a time zone shortly after we grounded on marsten your head started keeping time both in greenwich and in mars touchdown meridian time even though touchdown time kept falling farther behind hour after hour a simple index correction wont bother you my sweet you dont realize how smart you are zeb patted her hand then looked around at me captain may i propose a change in schedule lets hear it sir i would like two sequences first go back to windsor pg with the verniers preset for a hundred thousand klicks straight up and execute at once then translate back to our own universezerobut not to earthzero instead set up an orbit around marszero that orbit becomes our base of operations i said simple enough but why so that we will always have somewhere to go back to deety can write us a program that will place us back in that orbit something like g a y h  m e but based on marszerowith elbow room i asked daughter can you write such a program i think so pop an emergency scram g a y plus something deety paused sagan g a y s a g a n means to return to orbit around marszero builtin mnemonic satisfactory is that all copilot no sir our schedule breaks up naturally into a five group a four group a three a two and a one i would like to add to each group a return to orbit around marszero captain if you were on the verniers i wouldnt worry you know them so well i dont if i do fifteen rotations one right after the other im afraid ill make some tiny mistake and well wind up in analogandromedanebula in universe a thousandandtwo on z axis with no idea how wa got there or how to get home copilot you worry too much probably captain my whole life is based on being chicken at every opportunity ill breathe easier if i come back to a familiar orbit at the end of each group and
