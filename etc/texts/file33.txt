heated an apple pie i fed one sandwich to hilda holding it for her she says shes going to finish working then scrub before she eats anything more sharpie munched a sandwich while she carved that thing aunt hilda is rugged zebadiahalmost as rugged as you are more rugged than i am i could do an autopsy if i had tobut not while eating i think i speak for jake too i know you speak for pop he saw me feeding her turned green and went elsewhere go look at what shes been doing zebadiah hilda has found interesting things hmmm are you the little girl who had a tizzy at the idea of dissecting a dead alien no sir i am not ive decided to stay grown up its not easy but its more satisfying an adult doesnt panic at a snake she just checks to see if its got rattles ill never squeal again im grown up at last a wife instead of a pampered princess you will always be my princess i hope so my chieftain but to merit that i must learn to be a pioneer motherwring the neck of a rooster butcher a hog load while my husband shoots take his place and his rifle when he is wounded ill learnim stubborn i am grab a hunk of pie and go see hilda i know just what to do with the extra hundred kilos books photographs pops microfilm files and portable viewer pops rifle and a case of ammo that the weight schedule didnt allow for didnt know he had itwhat calibre seven point six two millimeters long cartridge glory be pop and i use the same ammo didnt know you carried a rifle zebadiah i dont advertise it its unlicensed i must show all of you how to get at it got any use for a ladys purse gun a needle gun skoda flchettes not much range but either they poison or they break up and expand and it fires ninety times on one magazine what are you deety honorable hatchet man no sir pop got it for meblack marketwhen i started working nights he said he would rather hire shysters to get me acquittedor maybe probationthan to have to go down to the morgue to identify my body havent had to use it in logan i hardly need it zebadiah pop has gone to a great deal of trouble to get me the best possible training in selfdefense hes just as highly trainedthats why i keep him out of fist fights because it would be a massacre he and mama decided this when i was a baby pop says cops and courts no longer protect citizens so citizens must protect themselves im afraid hes right my husband i cant evaluate my opinions of right and wrong because i learned them from my parents and havent lived long enough to have formed opinions in disagreement with theirs deety your parents did okay i think so but thats subjective as may be i was kept out of blackboard junglespublic schoolsuntil we moved to utah and i was trained to fight armed or unarmed pop and i noticed how you handled a sword your moulinets are like clockwork and when you drop into point guard your forearm is perfectly covered jake is no slouch he drew so fast i never saw it and cut precisely above the collar pop says you are better at it mmm longer reach hes probably faster deety the best swordmaster i ever had was your height and reach i couldnt even cross blades with him unless he allowed me to you never did say where you had taken up swordsmanship i grinned down at her ymca in downtown manhattan i had foil in high school i fiddled with saber and pe in college but i never encountered swordsmen until i moved to manhattan took it up because i was getting soft then during that socalled research trip in europe i met swordsmen with family traditionsons and grandsons and greatgrandsons of maitres darmes learned that it was a way of lifeand i had started too late deety i fibbed to hilda ive never fought a student duel but i did train in saber in heidelberg under the sbelmeister reputed to coach one underground korps he was the little guy i couldnt cross steel with fast up to then i had thought i was fast but i got faster under his tutelage the day i was leaving he told me that he wished he had had me twenty years sooner he might have made a swordsman of me you were fast enough this afternoon no deety you had his eye i attacked from the flank you won that fight not me not pop although what pop did was far more dangerous than what i did my captain i will not let you disparage yourself i cannot hear you women bless their warm hearts and strange mindsdeety had appointed me her hero that settled it i would have to try to measure up i cut a piece of apple pie ate it quickly while i walked slowly through the passage into the garagedidnt want to reach the morgue still eating the ranger was on its back with clothes cut away open from chin to crotch and spread nameless chunks of gizzard were here and there around the cadaver it gave off a fetid odor hilda was still carving ice tongs in left hand knife in her right greenish goo up over her wrists as i approached she put down the knife picked up a razor bladedid not look up until i spoke learning things sharpie she put down her tools wiped her hands on a towel pushed back her hair
