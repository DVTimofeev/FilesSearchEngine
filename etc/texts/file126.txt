pulled a watch from his waistcoat pocket glanced at it then moaned oh dear oh dear i shall be too late and ran even faster deety started after him deety i yelled she stopped short i want to find the rabbit hole then keep your eye on her youre not going down the hole on whom deety turned back toward the hedge row a little girl in a pinafore was hurrying toward the spot where the rabbit had disappeared oh but it didnt hurt her to go down the hole no but alice had lots of difficulties before she got out we havent time this is not a place we can stay why not nineteenthcentury england did not have advanced medicine zebbie put in hilda this isnt england read that slip i unfolded the scrap of paper read wonderland just so i agreed and handed it to my wife but it is modeled on england in the eighteensixties it either has no medicine like oz or prepasteur medicine possibly presemmelweiss deety do you want to die from childbed fever no i want to go to the mad tea party we can have a mad tea party i went mad several universes backand its time for lunch sharpie you win the order of nostradamus with diamond cluster may i ask two questions one may always ask is h p lovecraft on that list he got only one vote zebbie yours chthulhu be thanked sharpie his stories fascinate me the way snakes are said to fascinate birds but i would rather be trapped with the king in yellow than be caught up in the worlds of the necronomicon uh did any horrids get four votes no dear the rest of us prefer happy endings so do i especially when im in it did heinlein get his name in the hat four votes split two for his future history two for stranger in a strange land so i left him out ti didnt vote for stranger and ill refrain from embarrassing anyone by asking who did my god the things some writers will do for money samuel johnson said that anyone who wrote for any other reason was a fool johnson was a fat pompous gluttonous dirty old fool who would have faded into the obscurity he so richly deserved had he not been followed around by a spitlicking sycophant spell that psycho as in bloch i added did poul anderson get in or niven zebbie thats far more than two questions i havent even reached the second question which is what do we have for a mad tea party surprise glinda had a picnic basket placed in our dressing room i missed it i admitted you didnt look in the wardrobe sharpie grinned can sandwiches from oz be eaten in wonderland or will they softly and silently vanish away be off or ill kick you downstairs several hundred calories later i noticed a young man hovering nearby he seemed to want to speak but was too diffident to do so deety jumped up trotted toward him the reverend mister dodgson is it not im mrs zebadiah carter he quickly removed his straw boater mr dodgson yes uh mrs carter have we met long ago before i was married you are looking for alice are you not dear me why yes i am but how she went down the rabbithole dodgson looked relieved then she will be back soon enough i promised to return her and her sisters to christ church before dark you did i mean you will same thing depending on the coordinates come meet my family have you had luncheon oh i say i dont mean to intrude you arent intruding deety took him by the hand firmly since my treasure is stronger than most men he came along and let go her hand hastily as soon as she loosened her grip we men got to our feet hilda remained in lotus aunt hilda this is mr dodgson lecturer in mathematics at christ church college oxford my stepmother mrs burroughs how do you do mrs burroughs oh dear i am intruding not at all mr dodgson do sit down and this is my father dr burroughs professor of mathematics and my husband captain carter aunt hilda will you find a clean plate for mr dodgson the young don relaxed once introductions had been made but he was still far more formal than deety intended to permit he sat down on the turf placed his hat carefully beside him and said truly mrs burroughs ive just finished tea with three little girls deety ignored his protests while she piled his plate with little sandwiches and cakes sharpie poured tea from a thermos jug they nailed him down with cup and plate jake advised dont fight it son unless you really must leave are alices sisters safe why yes professor they are napping in the shade of a hayrick nearby but then relax in any case you must wait for alice what branch of mathematics do you pursue algebraic logic usually sir with some attention to its applications to geometry the reverend mr dodgson was seated so that he faced gay deceiver and sat in the shadow of her port wing but nothing in his manner showed that he noticed the anachronism have your studies led you into multidimensional noneuclidean geometries jake asked dodgson blinked i fear that i tend to be conservative in geometry rathuh father mr dodgson doesnt work in your field he works in mine dodgson raised his eyebrows slightly jake said my daughter did not introduce herself fully she is mrs carter but her maiden name is doctor d t burroughs her field is mathematical logic that is why i am so pleased that you are here mr dodgson your book symbolic logic is a milestone in our field but my dear lady i have not written a work titled symbolic logic ive confused things again it is
