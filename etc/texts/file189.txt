the right then switched on power deety where do you and your pop live logan utah how long does it take to get married there zebbie hilda cut in utah has no waiting time so we go to logan but does require blood test deety do you know zebbies nickname around campus the wasp for wassermann positive zebbie everybody knows that nevada is the only state that offers twentyfourhour service no waiting time no blood test so point this bomb at reno and sign off sharpie darling i said gently would you like to walk home from two thousand meters i dont know ive never tried it thats an ejection seat but no parachutes oh how romantic jake darling well sing the liebestod on the way down you sing tenor ill force a soprano and well die in each others arms zebbie could we have more altitude for the timing doctor burroughs gag that hitchhiker sharpie liebestod is a solo picky picky isnt deadonarrival enough jealous because you cant carry a tune i told dicky boy that should be a duet and cosima agreed with me sharpie button your frimpin lip while i explain one everybody at your party knows why we left and will assume that we headed for reno you probably called out something to that effect as you left i believe i did yes i did shut up somebody made a professional effort to kill doctor burroughs not just kill but overkill that combo of high explosive and thermit was intended to leave nothing to analyze but it is possible that no one saw us lift we were into this gowagon and i was goosing it less than thirty seconds after that booby trap exploded innocent bystanders would look at the fire not at us guilty bystanders there wouldnt be any a professional who boobytraps a car either holes up or crosses a state line and gets lost the party or parties who paid for the contract may be nearby but if they are hilda theyre in your house one of my guests oh shut it sharpie you are never interested in the morals of your guests if they can be depended on to throw custard pies or do impromptu strips or some other prank that will keep your party from growing dull that qualifies them however i am not assuming that the boss villain was at your party i am saying that he would not be lurking where the man might put the arm on him your house would be the best place to hide and watch the plot develop but guest or not he was someone who knew that doctor burroughs would be at your party hilda who knew that key fact she answered with uncustomary seriousness i dont know zebbie i would have to think think hard mmm not many several were invited because jake was comingyou for example i became aware of that but you werent told that jake would be present some were toldno brain for examplebut i cant imagine that old fool boobytrapping a car i cant either but killers dont look like killers they look like people how long before the party did you tell brainy that pop would be present i told him when i invited him mmm eight days ago i sighed the possibles include not only the campus but the entire globe so we must try to figure probables doctor burroughs can you think of anyone who would like to see you dead several  let me rephrase it who hates your guts so bitterly that he would not hesitate to kill your daughter as long as he got you and also bystanders such as hilda and me not that we figure save to show that he didnt give a hoot who caught it a deficient personality amoral who is he pop burroughs hesitated doctor carter disagreement between mathematicians can be extremely heated and i am not without fault youre telling me pop but these quarrels rarely result in violence even the death of archimedes was only indirectly related to hisourprofession to encompass my daughter as wellno even doctor brain much as i despise him does not fit the picture deety said zeb could it have been me they were shooting at you tell me whose dolly have you busted hmm i cant think of anyone who dislikes me even enough to snub me sounds silly but its true its the truth put in sharpie deety is just like her mother was when janedeetys mother and my best friend until we lost herwhen jane and i were roommates in college i was always getting into jams and jane was always getting me outand never got into one herself a peacemaker so is deety okay deety youre out of it so is hilda and so am i as whoever placed that booby trap could not predict that either hilda or i would be in blast range so its pop theyre gunning for who we dont know why we dont know when we figure out why well know who meantime weve got to keep pop out of range im going to marry you as fast as possible not only because you smell good but to give me a legitimate interest in this fight so we go first to reno shut up sharpie weve been on course for reno since we leveled off i flipped on the transponder but to the left not right it would now answer with a registered legal signal but not one registered to my name this cost me some shekels i did not need but were appreciated by a tightlipped family man in indio sometimes it is convenient not to be identified by sky cops every time one crosses a state line but we arent going to reno those cowboy maneuvers were intended to deceive the eye radar and heat seekers the evasion against the heat seekersthat rough turn while we were still in glideeither
