squeaky did lean on me but i made it look the other way around and he managed to smile and to sing with me gaudeamus igitur hilda sang the bastard king to bertie which seemed both to shock him and make him laugh the odd way she held his arm told me that she was prepared to plant  poisoned darts in berties left armpit if anything went sour no one bothered us bertie returned a dozen or more salutes but at gay deceiver we ran into a bobble four armed soldiers guarded our smart girl by the starboard door was that fathead moresby looking smug as we came close he saluted aiming it at bertie bertie did not return his salute whats the meaning of this he said pointing plastered to gays side bridging the line where her door fairs into her afterbody was hims imperial seal moresby answered governor i understood you perfectly when you told me that i had work to do verb sap eh bertie didnt answer moresby continued to hold salute major general moresby bertie said so quietly that i could just hear it sir go to your quarters send me your sword i thought fathead was going to melt down the way the wicked witch did when dorothy threw the pail of water over her he brought down the salute and left moving quickly everybody acted as if nothing had happened hilda said gay deceiver open starboard doorshe did and that seal broke bertie were going to need people to carry things i dont want our possessions stacked outdoors he looked down at her surprised is the war over there never was a war bertie but you tried to push us around and i dont push you requisitioned this craft its legally

to round up a working party hilda will a dozen be enough better make it twenty and about four more armed guards twenty and four additional sentries once you pass that word put the senior rating in charge and climb into a tub of hot water cold water what hilda cold hot is okay if he uses lots of epsom salts otherwise icecold water will bring the swelling down faster even though its uncomfortable
