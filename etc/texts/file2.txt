you had best go straight home the chancellor will be trying to reach you she turned her back on him deety you started to add something sharp corners can intimidate internal revenue agents she hadnt cut loose on brainyjust a warning shot across his bow but from his face one would have thought she had hulled him however her remark to deety left me no time to see whether he would have a stroke not deety hilda me zeb quiet zebbie whatever it is the answer is no deety go ahead dear hilda corners is related to that famous mule i did not use a baseball bat because she comes only up to my armpits

visualized two overnight bags strapped into one back seat with my prospective fatherinlaw stashed in the other i dont have much but pop has two big bags and a fat briefcase i had better show you damn perhaps you had better i like my own rig i dont like to drive other peoples cars and while deety probably handled controls as smoothly as she danced i did not know that she didand im chicken i didnt

corner ill unlock it and turn on the lights she reached into her fathers inside jacket pocket took out a magic wand wait for baby the shout was from our hostess hilda was running down the path from her house purse clutched in one hand and about eight thousand newdollars of sunset mink flying like a flag from the other so the discussion started over seems sharpie had decided to come along to make certain that jake behaved himself and had taken just long enough to tell max her bouncerbutlerdriver when to throw the drunks out or cover them with blankets as needed she listened to deetys summary then nodded got it i can handle yours deety jake and i will go in it you ride with zebbie dear she turned to me hold down the speed zebbie so that i can follow no tricks buster dont try to lose us or youll have cops busting out of your ears i turned my sweet innocent eyes toward her why sharpie darling you know i wouldnt do anything like that youd steal city hall if you could figure a way to carry
