children i stood up the whole gangling length of me maam id be honored to take you to some quiet place where you could cry on me all you please seveni think it was seven protein types and two computersjumped on me the essence was you cant take maureen away from her own party with ugly overtones of lynching the wind had freshened to force six so i took liberal doses of champagne to insure against seasickness after a bit i napped it had been a busy day and i still was not over the shock of seeing a large freighter roadable about to take gays door off before i could close it and bounce that was when i kicked the cop in the stomach ordinarily i dont kick cops it makes one conspicuous then a piercing voice was saying flag chief of staff carters presence on the bridge is requested by the commodore and i wondered why the silly son of a bitch didnt comply so that the noise would stop then something cold was poking my tender bare ribs thats you doc ill help you relax i was relaxed past tense some of doras waldoes arent too gentleor maybe these werent people waldoes but for cargo i admit that im fairly large for a growing boy in the lift i decided that the beaufort scale was at least eight more likely nine nevertheless we got to the bridge right out of hollywood a whole dome of displays and clocksall moving slowly widdershins yet gay made do with just an instrument board i heard sharpie say my god look at him deety was saying something about we can shift seats if necessary to lor while laz was saying drink this i said firmly i do not drink beshides i been dring yr fashe is all blurry it must have been laz and lor who pinned me from both sides each with an arm lock and a nerve pinch deety wouldnt do that to me sharpie was holding my nose and laz was pouring it down my throat it fumed and bubbled then well there must have been a stowaway deety wouldnt do that not to me they let go of me when i finished swallowing i left the ship made a fast inspection circuit checked the milky way and returned to a precision grounding my ears fell off but it didnt seem military to stoop over and pick them up besides sharpie is playful flag chief of staff reports to the commodore as ordered how do you feel zebbie i feel fine maam is there any reason why i shouldnt i suppose not youve had a nap i did drop off dreamt i was in the tasmanian sea in a small vessel very uneasy body of water i added aside from that nightmare now gone im in top shape orders maam we gave everybody the twodollar tour including the bathrooms in the land of oz libby deety and jake waited outside the place being crowded sharpie ruled that laz could relieve lor to allow lor to look first then lor took back the captaincy so that her sister could see the fairyland bathrooms made the biggest hit i concede that the timespace twister is not impressive then the twins thanked hilda and left attention please said hilda if you wish we will show how we operate lazarus may use the astrogators seat while deety makes responses from the cargo space elizabeth will go back there too as she has ridden in gay deceiver deety before you move aft show maureen and lazarus how we squeeze a passenger into the rear seats ill scootch over this car operates in several modes as a roadable it is fast comfortable easy to handle rather hard to park and is usually parked with wings raked back as they are now the hypersonic configuration if we intended to drive it in the air the wings would usually be extended for maximum lift when operated by the burroughs continua device wing rake does not
