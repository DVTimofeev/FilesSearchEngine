says copilot she does not mean jacob darling this is your little wifey pop is a slow learner but he can learn just drop an anvil on him yes hilda aunt hilda let the seconds creep past never took her eyes off pop i was embarrassed pop isnt usually that slowthen the anvil hit yes captain please do not interrupt the chief pilots presentation her tone was warm and sweet i dont think our guests realized that pop had just been courtmartialed convicted keelhauled and restored to dutyon probation but i knew it zeb knew itpop knew it aye aye captain i concluded that captain auntie never intended to stand outside she had told me to offer my seat to squeaky and had added why dont you suggest to your father that he offer his to the governor i dont need an anvil it was a foregone conclusion that bertie would object to ladies having to stand while he sat but if he had not i feel certain that the hillbilly would have held up proceedings until she was seated where she could watch everyone but our visitors could not watch her how tall was machiavelli as they were climbing out the brigadier was telling me that he understood how she was controlledbut how did she flap her wingsand i answered that technical questions were best put to the captaini was unsurprised to hear capn auntie say certainly bertie if you dont mind being squeezed between deety and me mind i should pay for the privilege certainly you should i agreedthe hillbillys eyes widened but she let me talk what am i offered to scrunch over i slapped myself where im widest squeaky is a snakes hipsnot me are you open to a bribe how big a bribe a purse of gold and half the county or cream tarts at tea oh much more a bath a bath in a tub with loads of hot water and lots of suds the last time i bathed was in a stream and it was coooold  i shivered for him the governor appeared to think squeaky do we have a bathtub lady herbert interrupted bertie i was thinking of the princess suite my deah since you are all one family it popped into mind two bedrooms two bathrooms two bathtubs the drawing room is gloomy rather i answered bertie you didnt talk fast enough betty gets the first ride oh no no no i dont fly even in our own flying carriage hahrooomph squeaky boomed are you still open to a bribe you might try our captain shes as corruptible as i am aunt hilda picked it up now that ive heard that two bathtubs go with the suite my cup runneth over but my husband and my soninlaw have matters to discuss with the governors technical staff i dont have to be bribed to offer a few joy rides brigadierone passenger at a time and as deety implies not too wide a passenger aunt hilda added betty i must confess my own weakness clothes what i am wearing for example a ferrara original an exclusivemario himself created it for me while it is intended for saltwater yachting it is just as practical for space yachtingand i couldnt resist it do you have nice shops here bertie answered for his wife hilda there are shopsbut windsor city is not london however betty has a seamstress who is clever at copying styles from pictures in periodicals from homeold but new to us he added shell show you what we have now concerning this ride

astrogator car is trimmed captain copilot belt fastened door seal checked continua device ready passenger said capn auntie eh what should a passenger report principally that your belt is secure but i saw to that myself by using a web belt from our sleeping bag to link hildas seat belt to mine i must ask one question aunt hilda went on are you subject to motion sickness the channel can be rough and so can the straits of dover did mal de mer ever hit you oh ill be right short flight and all that one bonine deety general admiral lord nelson was seasick all his life my husband and i are susceptible we took our pills earlier today deety and zebbie are the horrid sort who eat greasy sandwiches during a typhoon and laugh at the dying i dont laugh i protested but these pills enable us to laugh right back is this not so jacob bertie they work youd be a fool not to take one i must add captain auntie said sweetly that if you refuse we will not lift bertie took it i told him chew it and swallow it dont hide it in your cheek captain i think that does it except that we are crowded general would you be more comfortable if you put an arm around each of us the general did not refuse it occurs to me that take him for a ride has several meanings captain auntie has more twists than a belly dancer routine has been
