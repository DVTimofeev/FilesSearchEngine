will you show me how what kind of target do we need it ought to be a large sheet of paper to show how the shot spreads but captain you know what will happen if i fire a gun what we will have two men back here at a dead runone of them trying to dress as he runs i dont think hell be pleased meaning i shouldnt get zebbie angry twice in ten minutes it might be your husband stands to reason that theyll both take care of needs before returning if i fire a shot id better have a dead body to show for it or one or the other will blow his top or both both thanks deetyi didnt think it through but also the captain will recall that she ordered me to guard camp i cant teach shooting at the same time sharpie cant you do anything right no of course you cant deety im off to a bad start all of you annoyed at me and one maybe two really angry does the captain expect me to comment deety cant you call me aunt flilda i wasnt cryingive trained myself not to but i needed to yes i want your comment captain aunt hilda i need to call you by your title to keep myself reminded that you are captain since you ordered me to refrain from personal remarks to you or about you i needed a second order before i could comment as bad as that dont spare me but make it quick the captain hasnt done badly i havent deety dont fib to hilda you never used to and im not going to now captain i think you are off to a good start but you said it had gone to my head i was wrong i realized how wrong when i was logging your order to me what i said was worse than anything i said to zebadiah while he was captain he required me to review in my mind all the things ive said and at least twice he should have given me a fat lipdeety smiled grimlycept that zebadiah couldnt bring himself to strike a woman even if she werent pregnant captaincaptain aunt hilda honeyzebadiah didnt crack down on us when he should have he turned over to you a gang of rugged individualists not one with any concept of discipline i certainly had none but i do now im not sure that i do i said miserably it means obeying orders you dont like and strongly disagree withwith no back talk into the jaws of death rode the six hundred zebadiah would not do that to us but he did let us annoy him into testing my new bugout program he had told me that the test was a useless risk i should have agreed because it was useless instead i gave him a snooty no comment and you were as bad and pop was worse mmm dont think zebadiah has had much experience as a commanding officer why so deety he is a captain that doesnt mean that he has ever been a commanding officer he has soloed quite a lot in fighters he has logged control time in larger craft or he wouldnt hold a command pilot rating but has he ever actually commanded nothing he has said to me indicated it but he did tell me that before the last war a major was often captain of an airandspace craft but now it almost always took a lieutenant colonel while majors wound up as copilots he was explaining why he liked oneman fighters so well aunt hildacaptaini think commanding was as new to zebadiah as it is to you like sex or having a baby you cant understand it till youve tried it she suddenly grinned so dont hold zebadiahs mistakes against him what mistakes hes saved our lives again and again i dont blame him nowfor wanting a rest from commanding deety its the hardest work possible even if you dont lift a finger i never suspected it i dont expect to sleep a wink tonight well guard you yes we will pipe down sorry maam what mistakes did zebbie make well he didnt crack down you wasted no time in letting us know who is boss you didnt let us argue you slapped us down at once i hate to say this but i think you have more talent for command than zebadiah has deety thats silly is it napoleon wasnt tall so i have a napoleonic complex humph captain im going to ignore that because under that order you made me log im damned if i do and damned if i dont well i know how not to get a napoleonic complex deety youre my secondincommand but pop is secondincommand wrong tense washe is no longer as astrogator you may have inherited it anyhow you can ask zebbiebut in private my decision is not subject to debate simply acknowledge it i aye aye captain you are now required to advise me whenever you think that i am about to make a serious mistake you are also required to advise me on request my advice isnt worth much look how i goofed a few minutes ago that was before you were appointed secondincommand deety actually holding an office makes a big difference deety blinked and looked solemn then said soberly yes i think it does yes it does i feel it i do weird wait till youre captain eight times as weird never pop wouldnt go for it zebadiah wouldnt i wontthats three votes i said no right up to the point where i could not avoid it dont worry about it now ill boss and youll advise me in that case captain i advise you to reconsider letting us guard you after we eat and start scouting again i advise that even if we find the british quickly instead of making contact we
