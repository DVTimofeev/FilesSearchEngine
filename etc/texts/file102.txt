for cannabis magnifica martiaexcept acreage for food crops brigadier hirdjones suggested norfolk plantation he smiled shall we just a moment aunt hilda said if i understood the brigadiers note we can vary the program captain hilda the carriage and i are at your disposal as long as you wish my orders and my pleasure brian i have clothing being made up i was told that sewing would continue through the night where should we go to inquire here and now i fancy i saw a package being delivered while weve been chatting it could be yours it would go to the chief housekeeper who would have it placed in your digsthe princess suite is it not yes brian ill slip upstairs and see please no brian made a small gesture a private soldier appeared out of nowhere smathers my greetings to mrs digby has a package arrived for captain burroughs sir hold it brian if it has arrived i want it fetched here i could see the look in brians eye that pop gets just before he starts demanding explanations for female unreasonable behavior but brian simply added if the package has arrived tell mrs digby that it must be delivered here at once double time so to speak sir the private stomped an aboutface and broke into a run hilda said thank you brian if i place it in our craft it is one less detail to remember your kindness eases my mind a pleasure captain hilda hilda that clothing is not yet paid for oh dear you are right jacob leftenant where does one exchange gold for local money do you know the rate of exchange in grams or in troy ounces i added brian behaved as if he had not heard us he turned toward his roadable parkins take a turn around the circle when you return i want that steam up high so that we wont creep in starting roight sir the wagon moved off at a headlong slow walk when no one else was in earshot brian said quietly i missed what you were saying because of engine noise but let me mention in passing that possession of gold by individuals is not permitted so iamhappytolearnthatyouhavenone he said not letting himself be interrupted let me add he went on that since i handle secret and mostsecret despatches i know things that i dont know if i make my meaning clear for example i am grateful that you four were willing to lose sleep last night others feel strong obligations to such good friends the brigadier mentioned that you might have purchases to make or bills to pay i was instructed to charge anything you need or want or fancyto the imperial household signing his name and appending my signature oh thats most unfair truly captain i fancy that those in authority will find something to add until you feel that you have been treated generously thats not what she means son put in pop unfair in the opposite direction we pay for what we get brian lost his smile may i suggest that the professor discuss that with the brigadier i would find it extremely embarrassing to have to report to the brigadier that i was unable to carry out his orders captain what deety i am required to advise you advise away my dear i see my packages coming captain auntie youve got a bear by the tail let go the hillbilly grinned and stuck out her tongue at me then turned to brian the brigadiers thoughtful arrangements are appreciated we accept it was still a few minutes before we left as it turned out that zebadiahs power packs were ready in the hands of the household engineer at last hildas clothes and the power packs were in gay we boarded the charbanc and whizzed away at  kmhr norfolk plantation captain hilda brian at what time did you breakfast oh thats not

that aunt hilda had decided to get everything else done before we went to look at vermin even so i did not have much appetiteuntil i decided to stand up and forthrightly turn coward not look at vermin cui bono aunt hilda was the expert that restored my appetite we stopped across the parade ground from imperial house we twigged in this orderzebadiah pop me aunt hildathat it was the officers club she

that way captain hilda the brigadier picks up the chit its charged against official visitors and winds up in london against hims civil list believe me his majesty gets paid more than leftenants or
