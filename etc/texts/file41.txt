was i that far off no darling you reported time since flash i didnt ask gay to range until after we were hypersonic oh i feel better captain inquired jake how did gay range an atomic explosion i would expect radiation to make it impossible does she have instrumentation of which i am not aware copilot she has several gadgets i have not shown you i have not been holding outany more than you held out in not telling me about guns and ammo you my apologies sir oh stuff it jake neither of us held out weve been running under the whip deety how long has it been since we killed that fake ranger that was seventeen fourteen it is now twentytwo twenty five hours six minutes i glanced at the board deetys circadian clock apparently couldnt be jarred by anything gays clock showed  greenwich with zone plus seven display call it five hoursfeels like five weeks we need a vacation loud cheers agreed sharpie check jake i didnt know that gay could range an atomic blast light beacon means a visible light to her just as radar beacon means to her a navigational radar beacon i told her to get a bearing on the light beacon directly aft she selected the brightest light with that bearing then i told her to take radar range and bearing on itspun my prayer wheel and prayed there was white noise possibly blanketing her radar frequency but her own radar bursts are tagged it would take a very high noise level at the same frequency to keep her from recognizing echoes with her signature clearly she had trouble for she reported plusminus of six hundred meters nevertheless range and bearing matched a fix in her permanents and told us our cabin had been bombed bad news but the aliens got there too late to bomb us good news captain i decline to grieve over material loss we are alive i agreealthough ill remember snug harbor as the happiest home ive ever had but there is no point in trying to warn earthour earthabout aliens that blast destroyed the clincher that aliens cadaver and papers and drawings you were going to turn over to your finnish friend im not sure we can go home again oh thats no problem captain two seconds to set the verniers not to mention the deadman switch and the program in gays permanents jake i wish you would knock off captain other than for command conditions zeb i like calling you captain so do imy captain me too capn zebbie dont overdo it jake i didnt mean that you cant pilot us home i mean we should not risk it weve lost our last lead on the aliens but they know who we are and have shown dismaying skill in tracking us down id like to live to see two babies born and grown up amen said sharpie this might be the place for it out of a million billion zillion earths this one may be verminfree highly likely hilda my dear there are no data on which to base any assumption jacob there is one datum eh what did i miss dear that we do know that our native planet is infested so i dont want to raise kids on it if this isnt the place were looking for lets keep looking mmm logical yes cap zeb i agree but we cant tell much before morning jake im unclear on a key point if we translated back to our own earth now where would we find ourselves and when pop may i answer that go ahead deety the time pop and i translated to the place with no j we thought we had failed pop stayed in our car trying to figure it out i went inside intending to fix lunch everything looked normal but the phone book was on the kitchen counter and doesnt belong there that book had a toll area map on its back cover my eye happened to land on juab countyand it was spelled luab and i thought what a funny misprint then i looked inside and couldnt find any js and dropped the book and went running for pop i thought deety was hysterical but when i checked a dictionary and the britannica we got out in a hurry this is the point zebadiah when we flipped back i dashed into the house the phone book was where it belonged the alphabet was back the way it ought to be the clock in my head said that we had been gone twentyseven minutes the kitchen clock confirmed it and it agreed with the clock in the car does that answer you sir i think so in a translation duration just keeps chugging along i wondered because id like to check that crater after it has had time to cool down what about that one rotation harder to figure zebadiah we werent in that other spacetime but a few seconds and we both passed out indeterminate im convinced but jake what about earths proper motions rotation revolution around the sun sidereal motion and so forth a theoretical answer calls for mathematics you tell me are outside your scope of study uhzeb beyond my capacity you mean as you will sir an excursion elsewhereandelsewhen and return brings you back to where you would have been had you experienced that duration on earth but when requires further definition as we were discussing uh earlier this afternoon but it seems longer we can adjust the controls to reenter any axis at any point with permanent change of interval for planetary engineering or other purposes including reentry reversed against the entropy arrow but i suspect that would cause death why pop why wouldnt it just reverse your memory memory is tied to entropy increase my darling daughter death might be preferable to amnesia combined with prophetic knowledge uncertainty may be the factor that makes life
