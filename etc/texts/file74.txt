hesitatedmy bladder is not used to bedtime right after dinner when no one else spoke i said perhaps i had better be first i have breakfast to prepare dear you are not first cook today zebbie is deety grab a rifle and take your father to his handy bushand do make it handy that giant termite might be lurking then hand jacob the rifle and its your turn dont dally it was a busy day water tanks had to be topped off zeb and i used two collapsible buckets taking turns that hill got steeper every trip even at  gee while deety guarded us endless trips that afternoon i was a ladies tailor hilda had something for deety to do zeb had a job to complete the space behind the bulkhead has padeyes every  cms or so no one wants the center of gravity to shift when one is in the air zebs arrangements were samson cord in many lengths with snap hooks zeb told hilda he wanted to secure the bed aft for air or space and to store items used in rigging the forward bed so that they would be secure but availableand where were his samson tiesgay didnt know he had to explain to hilda what they looked likewhereupon hilda said oh thingammies gay deceiver inventory incidentals small thingammies zeb spent the afternoon making certain that the bed could not slide then built a net of samson cord to hold the items for turning seats into a bed then finding that he had samson ties left zeb removed the wires with which i had secured the aftermost storage and replaced them with ties when he was through he relieved me as guard and i wound up as seamstress our wives had decided that one of deetys jump suits should be altered for hilda until we reached some place where clothes could be purchased hilda had vetoed earthwithoutaj jacob as captain i look at things from another perspective it is better to be a lively frump than a stylish corpse wups you pinned sharpie thorry i said around a mouthful of pins hilda was wearing the suit inside out i was pinning excess material once this caused it to fit lines held by pins would be tacked pins removed tacked lines sewed in short stitches by hand deetys sewing machine was ashes in another universe and excess cloth trimmed away such was theory i tackled reducing the waist line by pinning darts on both sides then i folded up the trousers so that the crease came at the instepbut had to pin them up  cms seventeen centimeters i had taken in the waist first knowing that doing so would in effect shorten the trousers it didone centimeter the appearance was as if i were trying to fit her with a chimpanzee suit for a masquerade lift it at the shoulders i tried almost cutting off circulation still a horrid case of droopy drawers take a tuck all the way around the waist that suit closed with one zipper have you ever tried to take a tuck in a zipper i stepped back and looked at my creative artistry ghastly hilda my love deety was better at this by the age of ten shall i fetch her no no yes yes if at first you dont succeed find the mistake im the mistake you need deety no jacob it would be better for me to get along without clothes than to interrupt the work i have assigned to the astrogator with you at the verniers and zebbie at the controls gay can do almost anything and quickly yes i wouldnt phrase it that way but i understand you if shes been preprogrammed she can do it even faster certainly why the quiz dear how much faster without preprogramming it takes a few seconds to acknowledge and set it about as long to check what ive done then i report set zeb says execute i punch the button five to fifteen seconds with a preprogramis it debugged in all ways no conflicts no ambiguities no sounds easy to confuse darling that is why i wont let deety be disturbed yes so maximum time would be with gay asleep wake her she acknowledges you state the preprogram in the exact words in her memory then say execute call it three seconds minimum that would be an emergency preprogram with execute included in the code word my dear we saw minimum time yesterday when that russian tried to shoot zeb jacob that is what caused me to put deety to work i saw his pistol in the air his fingers were curled to catch it then we were in the sky how long i saw him start to reverse his weapon and bent over my verniers to bounce us by switch then stopped not needed mmm a tenth of a second a fifth whichever it is the fastest we can manage while you dears were carrying water i was preparing a list of preprograms some are to save juice or time or to carry out something we do frequently those require execute some are intended to save our lives and dont require execute like bounce and bug out and take us home but more jacob i did not tell deety how to phrase these thats her specialty i wrote out what i thought we ought to be able to do and told her to add any she wished did you consult zeb copilot the captain did not consult the chief pilot whew i beg your pardoncaptain only if i get a kissmind the pins deety will post a copy on the instrument board after you and zebbie read them i want your advice and his i gave up on that jump suit i took out eightyfive or a thousand pins hilda was covered with sweat so i invited her to order me to take her down to bathe she
