the fact that it took my voice to make a flight plan operative a skilled electron pusher might find a way to override my lock then drive her manually but the first time he attempted to use autopilot the car would not only not accept the program but would scream for help on all police frequencies this causes car thieves to feel maladjusted i looked up and saw that deety had been following this intently i waited for some question instead deety said she has a very pleasant voice zeb gay deceiver is a very nice girl deety and talented zeb i have never before been in a ford that can do the things this cargay deceivercan do after were married ill introduce you to her more formally it will require reprogramming i look forward to knowing her better you will gay is not exactly all ford her external appearance was made by ford of canada most of the rest of her once belonged to australian defense forces but i added a few doodads the bowling alley the powder room the veranda little homey touches im sure she appreciates them zeb i know i do i suspect that had she not had them we would all be as dead as canasta you may be right if so it would not be the first time gay has kept me alive you have not seen all her talents im beyond being surprised so far as i could see you didnt tell her to land at logan logan seems to be the next most likely place for a reception committee who in logan knows that you and your father were going to visit hilda no one through me mail milk cartons newspapers no deliveries to the house zeb she turned her head pop does anyone in logan know where we went doctor carter to the best of my knowledge no one in logan knows that we left having lived many years in the buzzing gossip of academe i have learned to keep my life as private as possible then i suggest that you all ease your belts and sleep until ten minutes before reaching logan there is little to do doctor carter better call me zeb pop get used to it zeb it is son on page eightyseven of your monograph after the equation numbered onetwentyone in your discussion of the rotation of sixdimensional spaces of positive curvature you said from this it is evident that and immediately write your equation onetwentytwo how did you do it im not disagreeing siron the contrary but in an unpublished paper of my own i used a dozen pages to arrive at the same transformation did you have a direct intuition or did you simply omit publishing details no criticism i am impressed either way sheer curiosity doctor i did not write that paper i told deety so that is what he claimed pop oh come now two doctors zebulon e carter on one campus no but thats not my name im zebadiah j carter zebulon eforedward carter and called ed is my cousin while he is probably listed as being on campus in fact he is doing an exchange year in singapore its not as improbable as it sounds all male members of my family have first names starting with z it has to do with money and a will and a trust fund and the fact that my grandfather and his father were somewhat eccentric whereas you arent hilda said sweetly quiet dear i turned toward deety deety do you want to be released from our engagement i did try to tell you that you had trapped the wrong bird zebadiah yes deety i intend to marry you before this night is over but you havent kissed me i want to be kissed i unfastened my seat belt started to unfasten hers found that she had done so deety kisses even better than she tangos during a break for oxygen i asked her in a whisper deety what do your initials stand for well please dont laugh i wont but i have to know them for the ceremony i know all right dee tee stands for dejah thoris dejah thoris dejah thoris burroughs dejah thoris carter i cracked up i got it under control after two whoops too many deety said sadly you said you wouldnt laugh deety darling i wasnt laughing at your name i was laughing at mine i dont think zebadiah is a funny name i like it so do i it keeps me from being mixed up with the endless bobs and eds and toms but i didnt tell my middle name whats a funny name starting with j i wont guess let me lead up to it i was born near the campus of the university thomas

each others shoulders howling after a bit the howling died down and turned into another kiss when we came up for air hilda tapped me on a shoulder would you let us in on the joke do we tell her deety
