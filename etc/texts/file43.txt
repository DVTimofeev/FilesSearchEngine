potato salad and used sandwich to the cabin air good thing i was still clutching that wayward pill aunt hilda struggled but shes a little bitty i treated her the way my husband had treated her husband then clamped my hand over her mouth i dont understand seasickness or freefall nausea i can walk on bulkheads with a sandwich in one hand and a drink in the other and enjoy it but the victims really are sick and somewhat out of their heads so i held her mouth closed and whispered into her ear chew it aunty darling and swallow it or im going to spank you with a club shortly i could feel her chewing after several minutes she relaxed i asked her is it safe for me to ungag you she nodded i took my hand away she smiled wanly and patted my hand thanks deety she added you wouldnt really beat aunt sharpie i sure would darling id cry and cry and wallop you and wallop you im glad i dont have to im glad too can we kiss and make upor is my breath sour it wasnt but i wouldnt have let that stop me i loosened my chest strap and hers and put both arms around her i have two ways of kissing one is suitable for faculty teas the other way i mean it i never got a chance to pick aunt hilda apparently never found out about the facultytea sort no her breath wasnt sourjust a slight taste of raspberry me im the wholesome type if it werent for those advertisements on my chest men wouldnt give me a second glance hilda is a miniature messalina pure sex in a small package funny how a person can grow up never really believing that the adults you grow up with have sexjust gender now my saintly father turns out to be an insatiable goat and aunt hilda who had babied me and changed my diapers is sexy enough for a platoon of marines i let her go while thinking pleasant thoughts about teaching my husband technique i had learnedunless hilda had taught him in the past no or he would have taught meand he hadnt shown her style of virtuosity zebadiah just wait till i get you alone which might not be too soon gay deceiver is wonderful but no honeymoon cottage there was space back of the bulkhead behind my headlike a big phone booth on its sidewhere zebadiah kept a sleeping bag and he says sometimes sacked out but it had the spacetime twister in it and nineteen dozen other things hilda and i were going to have to repress our primary imperative until our men found us a piedaterre on some planet in some universe somewhere somewhen marsbarsoom seemed to have grown while i was curing aunt hildas space sickness our men were talking astrogation my husband was saying sorry but at extreme range gays radar can see a thousand kilos you tell me our distance is about a hundred times that about were falling toward mars captain we must do it by triangulation not even a protractor where i can get at it how hmmmm if the captain pleases recall how you worked that tennessee windage my darling looked like a school boy caught making a silly answer jake if you dont quit being polite when im stupid im going to space you and put deety in the copilots seat no we need you to get us home id better resign and you take over zeb a captain cant resign while his ship is underway thats universal this is another universe transuniversal as long as you are alive you are stuck with it lets attempt that triangulation stand by to record zebadiah settled into his seat pressed his head against its rest copilot ready to record sir damn trouble captain some this reflectosight is scaled fifteen mils on a side concentric circles crossed at center point horizontally and vertically normal to deck and parallel to deck i mean when i center the fifteenmil ring on mars i have a border around it im going to have to guesstimate uh the border looks to be about eighteen mils wide so double that and add thirty sixtysix mils and a mil is onetoonethousand onetoonethousandandeighteen and a whisker actuallybut onetoathousand is good enough wait a halfi ive got two sharp high lights near the meridianif the polar caps mark the meridian leme tilt this buggy and put a line crossing themthen ill yaw and what we cant measure in one jump well catch in three i saw the larger upper polar cap north south well it felt north roll gently about eighty degrees while my husband fiddled with gays manual controls twentynine point five maybe plus eighteen point seven plus sixteen point three add my father answered sixtyfour and a half while i said six four point five in my mind and kept quiet who knows the diameter of mars or shall i ask gay hilda answered six thousand seven hundred fifty kilometers near enough plenty near enough for zebadiahs estimates zebadiah said sharpie how did you happen to know that i read comic books you knowzap polaris is missing i dont read comic books lots of interesting things in comic books zebbie i thought the aerospace force used comicbook instruction manuals my darlings ears turned red some are he admitted but they are edited for technical accuracy hmm maybe i had better check that figure with gay i love my husband but sometimes women must stick together dont bother zebadiah i said in chilly tones aunt hilda is correct the polar diameter of mars is six seven five two point eight plus but surely three significant figures is enough for your data zebadiah did not answerut did not ask his computer instead he said copilot will you run it off on your pocket calculator we can treat it as a tangent at
