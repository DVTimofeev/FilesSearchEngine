the baic ecret of cholatic ucce forgive my digreion we were speaking of men and women i am strong for womens rights but was never taken in by unisex nonsense i dont yearn to be equal sharpie is as unequal as possible with all the perks and bonuses and special privileges that come from being one of the superior sex if a man fails to hold a door for me i fail to see him and step on his instep i feel no shame in making lavish use of the strongest muscles namely male ones but my own strongest muscle is dedicated to the service of mennoblesse oblige i dont begrudge men one whit of their natural advantages as long as they respect mine i am not an unhappy pseudomale i am female and like it that way i borrowed makeup that deety rarely uses but i carry my own perfume in my purse and used it in the twentytwo classic places deety uses only the basic aphrodisiac soap and water perfume on her would be gilding the lily fresh out of a hot tub she smells like a harem if i had her natural fragrance i could have saved at least ten thousand newdollars over the years as well as many hours spent dabbing bait here and there she offered me a dress and i told her not to be silly any dress of hers would fit me like a tent you put something bridal and frilly around your hips and lend me your boldest gstring job dear i surprised you when i jockeyed you into taking off your halter after telling you that you were wise not to rush it but the chance showed up and i grabbed the ring on the fly weve got our men gentled to nearly naked and well hold that gain at first opportunity well get pants off all of us too without anything as childish as strip poker deety i want us to be a solid family and relaxed about it so that skin doesnt mean sex it just means we are home en famille your skin is pretty sexy nanny goat deety do you think im trying to make a pass at zebbie heavens no aunt hilda you would never do that piffle dear i dont have morals just customs i dont wait for a man to make a pass they fumble around and waste time but when i met him i picked zebbie for a chumso i gave him an opening he made a polite pass i carefully failed to see it and that ended it im sure hes as much fun on the workbench as you tell me he isbut bedmates are easy to find while worthwhile male friends are scarce zebbie is one to whom i can holler for help in the middle of the night and be certain hell rally around im not going to let that change merely because a weird concatenation now makes him my soninlaw besides deety although your old aunt sharpie may seem undignified i refuse to be the campus widow who seduces younger men save for minor exceptions close to my age i always have bedded older men when i was your age i tripped several three times my age educational it certainly is aunt hilda i got ninety percent of my instruction two years agoa widower three times my age i was programming for him and we took shared time when we could get it often after midnight i didnt think anything of it until one night i was startled to find that i was helping him to take off my panties then i was still more surprised to learn how little i had learned in seven years he gave me a tutored seminar usually three times a week all the time he was willing to spare mefor the next six months im glad i got tutoring from an expert before last night rolled aroundor zebadiah would have found me a dead arse willing but clumsy i didnt tell this to my darling i let him think he was teaching me thats right dear never tell a man anything he doesnt need to know and lie with a straight face rather than hurt his feelings or diminish his pride aunt nanny goat i just plain love you we quit yakking and looked for our men deety said that they were certain to be in the basement aunt hilda i dont go there without invitation its pops sanctum sanctorum youre warning me not to risk a faux pas im his daughter youre his wife not the same well he hasnt told me not toand today hell forgive me if ever where do
