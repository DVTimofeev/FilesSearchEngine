appears as second or third magnitude that wouldnt have to be far our sun is pretty faint so this could be the darkover universe or nivens known space or dr williamsons legion of space universe or the star trek universe or andersons world of the polesotechnic league or dr smiths galactic patrol world or several more sharpie what were two that this could not be king arthur and his knights and the world of the hobbits if we find ourselves in either of those we leave no obstetricians jake any reason to stay here longer none that i see i answered captain deety i advise scram those spaceopera universes can be sticky i dont care to catch a photon torpedo or a vortex bomb or a negativematter projectile just through failure to identify ourselves promptly so we rotated this time we werent merely close we were on the ground charging straight at us was a knight in armour lance couched in attack i think it unlikely that a lance could damage gay but this gentle knight was unfriendly i shouted gayzoom sighed with relief at sudden darkness and at the captains next words thanks pop you were on your toes thank you end of group three back to mars  a g a n lets get on with it zeb agreed all hands zebadiah my daughter interrupted is that all you wish to see of king arthur and his knights captain deety that wasnt one of king arthurs knights he was wearing plated mail thats my impression my beloved agreed but i gave more attention to his shield field sable argent bend sinister in chief sun proper with crown both or sir modred my daughter decided i knew he was a baddie zebadiah we should have hit him with your lgun killed that beautiful beerwagon horse deety that sort of armor wasnt made earlier than the fifteenth century eight or nine centuries after the days of king arthur then why was he carrying sir modreds shield sharpie was that sir modreds coat of arms i dont know i blazoned what i saw arent you nitpicking in objecting to plate armor merely because its anachronistic but history shows that thats the point zebbie camelot isnt history its fiction zeb said slowly shut my big mouth zebbie i venture to guess that the version of camelot we blundered into is a patchwork of all our concepts of king arthur and the round table i picked up mine from tennyson revised them when i read le morte darthur where did you get yours mark twain gave me minea connecticut yankee in king arthurs court add some prince valiant jake i said zeb there seems little doubt that there was a king or a general named arthur or arturius but most people think of king arthur from stories having little connection with any historical person the sword in the stone and the once and future king are my favorites my daughter persisted i do believe in the round table i do we should go back and look instead of guessing captain deety her husband said gently the jolly murderous roughnecks called the knights of the round table are fun to read about but not to know socially nor are people the only dangers there would be honesttogod dragons and wyverns and malevolent magicnot the glindathegood variety weve learned that these alternate worlds are as real as the one we came from we dont need to relearn it by getting suddenly dead thats my official advice if you dont agree will you please relieve me at the conn maam zebadiah youre being logicala most unfair way to argue jacob said my wife suppose we were people who dont like fanciful stories what sort of worlds would we find i dont know hilda probably only humdrum sliceoflife universes indistinguishable from the real world correction substitute universezero for real worldbecause as your theory requires all worlds are equally real or unreal jacob why do you call our universe universezero ehor convenience our point of origin didnt you tell me that no frame is preferred over any other each one to the number of the beast is equally zero in six axes well theory requires it then we are fiction in other universes have i reasoned correctly i was slow in answering that seems to be a necessary corollary its a disturbing idea that we ourselves are figments of imagination im nobodys figment my daughter protested im real i am pinch meuch zebadiah not so hard you asked for it dear zeb told her my husband is a brute and ive got a cruel stepmother just like snow white i mean cinderella and my pop thinks im imaginary but i love you anyway because youre all ive got if you fictional characters will pipe down well get this show on the road stand by to rotate gay sagan mars was where it should be i felt more real xxxvi pipe down and do your job hilda set captain i reported thirteenth rotation correct zebbie check sharpie captain deety answered lets catch our breaths she stared out at the ruddy barrenness of marszero that rock looks downright homelike i feel like a tourist who tries to see thirty countries in two weeks shock not future shock but something like it homesickness i told her knowing that we cant go back deety somewhere somewhen well build another snug harbor wont we jacob jacob patted my knee we will dearest deety said wistfully will we really find another snug harbor deety are you over your pioneermother jag no zebadiah but i can get homesick like you like hilda like everybody but pop correction daughter i dont miss logan and i dont think hilda misses california not a bit i agreed nor me agreed zeb i had a rented flat but snug harbor was home agreed jacob answered i didnt really hate these vermin until they bombed our home jacob added weve
