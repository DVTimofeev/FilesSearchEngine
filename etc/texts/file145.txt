devise a grammar for spacetime complexities in six curved dimensions i cant contribute much but i can try to punch holes in your work love to i wasnt fooling my twin is so sweet that maybe deety is fairly sweet herself xli a cat can be caught in almost any trap once jacob if a then b i trust i am a rational mathematician not one of the romantics who have brought disrepute to our calling through such inanities as defining infinity as a number confusing symbol with referent or treating ignorance as a datum when i found myself in the land of oz i did not assume that i had lost my reason instead it prepared me emotionally to meet other fictional characters stipulated i may be in a locked ward but to assume that to be factual serves no purpose other than suicide of personality i shall act on what my senses report i am not the bumpkin who said on seeing a giraffe there aint no sich animal i find myself in bed with my lovely wife hilda in sumptuous quarters of star yacht dora as guests of the utterly fictional lazarus long is this a reason to try to find the call button in order to ask a stillmorefictional nurse for a nonexistent shot to end this hallucination this is an excellent bed as for hilda solomon has reason to envi me mahomet with all his houris is not as blessed as i tomorrow is soon enough to unravel any paradox or the day after tomorrow better yet not this october after the end of eternity may be best why disturb a paradox as dora pointed out hilda and i are a pair o docs ourselves  with no wish to be disturbed and most certainly not to be unravelled since hilda married me i have not once taken a sleeping pill no one called us i woke up feeling totally rested found my wife in the fresher brushing her teeth with yes pepsodentremoved brush from mouth kissed her
