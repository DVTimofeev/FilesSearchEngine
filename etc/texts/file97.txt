going to give him in which case he will swap the times around with the visit to the wogs we arent going to make and that jake is the reason i asked the captain for a family conference i already knew that artificial isotopes are far beyond this culturenot alone from the ride this afternoon but because i ask questions myself squeaky has a knowledge of chemistry about the prenuclear level and a detailed knowledge of explosives that one expects of a pro but to squeaky atoms are the smallest divisions of mass and heavy water is a meaningless phrase so i knew we would be here just to get sharpie some clothes and to recharge my packssince they do have dc power then i found we had stumbled onto the home of the verminand at that point my back didnt ache at the idea of cranking and i didnt think that the captain was that much in a hurry to buy clothes so i asked the captain to call us together in smart girl i did not want to put it off even a few minutes because we were scheduled to move into our suite after tea to leave at once before we moved in would save awkward explanations jake did i have reason to ask for emergency conference if you had told me stop the captain told you but she didnt explain jake youre hopeless captains dont have to explain furthermore she could not because i did not tell anyone until now the captain had confidence in my judgment you could have explained when hilda sent you back to get me i would have come at once that makes the ninth time youve been wrong in twenty minutes i blurted tenth zebadiah i counted pop gave me his ettubrute look tenth without being right once i could not have explained to you merely because of a group of men eleventh i was not sent back to get youtwelfth i was under orders to tell you thatquotewe lift in five minutes tell you that and no more then turn and leave at once without discussion i carried out my orders you hoped that i would be left behind thirteen i butted in again pop quit making a fool of yourself zebadiah asked you an essential questionand youve dodged captain auntie could we have the doors closed there might be one of them out thereand the guns are locked up certainly deety gay deceiver close your doors pop said deety i was not aware that i had been dodging i thought i was conducting a reasonable discussion pop you always think so but you are reasonable only in mathematics zebadiah asked you whether or not under the circumstances did he have reason to ask for a conference you havent answered it if hilda had not told him not to pop answer that question or i will never speak to you again in my life my husband said deety deety dont make threats my husband i never make threats either pop knows it pop took a deep breath zeb under the circumstances you have described you were justified in asking the captain for an immediate private conference i let out my breath thanks pop i did it for myself deety hilda captain what is it jacob i should have gone with you at once when you first asked me to thank you jacob but i did not ask you i ordered you true it was phrased as a request but orders of a commanding officer are customarily phrased as requestsa polite protocol
