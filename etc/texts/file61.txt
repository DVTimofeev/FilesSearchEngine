to me here i treated it as geometry length of tangent for an angle of four degrees thirtyseven minutes four and half degrees where in the world did you get that figure oh sorry dear i skipped about six steps on earth one nautical mile is one minute of arccheck yes subject to minor reservations with a sextant or in dead reckoning or on a chart a mile is a minute a minute is a mile makes it simple otherwise we would be saying a minute is one thousand eight hundred fiftythree meters and the arithmetic would get hairy oneeightfivethree point oneeightsevensevenohfive plus she corrected me very hairy best not convert to mks until the last step but zebadiah there is a simpler relation here one minute of arc equals one kilometer near enough not to matter so i treated haboveg ten klicks as a versine applied the haversine rule and got four degrees thirtyseven minutes or two hundred seventyseven kilometers to the theoretical horizon you see i see everything but how you hide haversine tables in a jump suit me i hide em in gay and make her do the work yes i could nose her over noweasy does it boy well i didnt exactly i calculated it but i did it the easy way naperian logarithms and angles in radians then converted back to degrees to show the relationship to kilometers on the ground thats the easy way it is for me sir if youre quivering your chin stop it i told you it was your luscious body not your brain most idiotssavants are homely and cant do anything but their one trick but youre an adequate cook as well that got me a stony silence i kept easing her nose down time for binox jake aye aye sir captain i am required to advise you with that last remark to the astrogator you risked your life are you implying that deety is an inadequate cook why jake hilda interrupted shes a gourmet cook i know she is sharpie but i dont like to say it where gay can hear gay cant cook nor has she deetys other talent which tis death to hide jake thats a settlement below of sorts a onechurch village do you see ornithopters anything that could give us trouble depends are you interested in church architecture jake this is no time for a cultural chat im required to advise you sir this church has towers something like minarets topped off with onionshaped structures russian orthodox hilda said that i said nothing i eased gays nose up to level flight lined her up with what i thought was downstream and snapped gay scout the canal was still in sight almost under us and stretching over the horizon i was almost lined up with it gay scout anybody see that settlement that was almost ahead before this last transition report captain zebbie its much closer now but on this side i see or dont jake isnt transparent captain the cityquite largeis about a fortyfivedegree slant down to starboard not in sight from your seat if fortyfive degrees is a close guess a minimum transition on that bearing should place us over the city captain i advise against it jake told me reasons please this is a large city that might be well defended their ornithopters look odd and ineffective but we must assume they have spaceships as good or better than ours or the tsar could not have a colony here this causes me to suspect that they may have smart missiles or weapons utterly strange i would rather check for onion towers from a distance and not stay long in one placei think weve been here too long im jumpy im notmy sixth sense was not jabbing mebut set verniers for a minimum transition along l axis then execute at will no need to be a slow fat target one minimum l axisset suddenly my guardian angel goosed me execute i noticed the transition principally because gay was now live under my handair bite perhaps she had not been quite level i turned her nose down to gather maneuvering speed unpowered then did a skew turnand yelped gay bounce having seen all that i wanted to see an expanding cloud atomic i think not lethal you test it im satisfied i told gay to bounce three more times placing us a bit less than fifty klicks above ground then i spent a trifle of power to nose her over jake use the binox to see how far this valley runs whether it is all cultivated whether it has more settlements we are not going to get close enough to look for onion spires that last shot was unfriendly rude impetuous or am i prejudiced science officer le mot juste sil vous plait nye kultoorni i remember that one makes russians turn green what does it mean how did you happen to know it sharpie means what it sounds like uncultured i didnt just happen capn zebbie i know russian i was flabbergasted why didnt you say so you didnt ask me sharpie if you handled the negotiations we might not have had trouble zebbie if youll believe that youll believe anything he was calling you a spy and insulting you while the palaver was still in french i thought it might be advantageous if they thought none of us knew russian they might spill something did they no the colonel was coaching his pilot in how to be arrogant then you told them to halt in french and no more russian was spoken save for meaningless side remarks zebbie when they tried to shoot us down just now would they have refrained had they known that i had studied russian mmm sharpie i should know better than to argue with you im going to vote for you for captain oh no oh yes copilot im going to assume that everything this side of the
