afternoon showed me how much he was like the warlord of mars a sword those old stories were familiar to me my father had acquired the ballantine del rey paperback reissues they were around the house when i was a little girl once i learned to read i read everything and vastly preferred barsoom stories to girls books given to me for birthdays and christmas thuvia was the heroine i identified withtoy of the cruel priests of issus then with virginity miraculously restored in the next book thuvia maid of mars i resolved to change my name to thuvia when i was old enough when i was eighteen i did not consider it i had always been hilda a new name held no attraction i was responsible in part for deetys name one that embarrassed her until she discovered that her husband liked it jacob had wanted to name his daughter dejah thoris jacob looks like and is a professor but he is incurably romantic jane had misgivings i told her dont be a chump janie if your man wants something and you can accommodate him with no grief give it to him do you want him to love this child or to resent her jane looked thoughtful and doris anne became dejah thoris at christening then deety before she could talkwhich satisfied everyone we settled into a routine up early every day our men worked on instruments and wires and things and installing the timespace widget into gay deceivers gizzardwhile deety and i gave the housework a lick and a promise our mountain home needed little attentionmore of jacobs genius then deety and i got busy on a technical matter that deety could do with some help from me im not much use for technical work biology being the only thing i studied in depth and never finished my degree this was amplified by almost six thousand hours as volunteer nurses aid in our campus medical center and i took courses that make me an uncertified nurse or medical tech or even jackleg paramedici dont shriek at the sight of blood and can clean up vomit without a qualm and would not hesitate to fill in as scrub nurse being a campus widow with too much money is fun but not soul filling i like to feel that ive paid rent on the piece of earth im using besides that i have a smattering of everything from addiction to the printed page plus attending campus lectures that sound intriguing then sometimes auditing a related course i audited descriptive astronomy took the final as if for creditgot an a i had even figured a cometary orbit correctly to my surprise and the professors i can wire a doorbell or clean out a stoppedup soil pipe with a plumbers snakebut if its really technical i hire specialists so hilda can help but usually cant do the job alone gay deceiver had to be reprogrammedand deety who does not look like a genius is one jacobs daughter should be a genius and her mother had an iq that startled even me her closest friend i ran across it while helping poor griefstricken jacob to decide what to save what to burn i burned unflattering pictures useless papers and clothes a dead persons clothes should be given away or burned nothing should be kept that does not inspire happy memories i cried a bit and that saved jacob and deety from having to cry later we all held private duo licenses zebbie as captain z j carter usasr held command rating as wellhe told us that his space rating was largely honorary just some freefall time and one landing of a shuttle zebbie is mendacious untruthful and tells fibs i got a chance to sneak a look at his aerospace log and shamelessly took it he had logged more than he claimed in one exchange tour with australia someday im going to sit on his chest and make him tell mama hilda the truth should be interesting if i can sort out fact from fiction i do not believe his story about intimate relations with a female kangaroo zebbie and jacob decided that we all must be able to control gay deceiver all four ways on the road in the air in trajectory shes not a spaceship but can make hightrajectory jumps and in spacetime ie among the universes to the number of the beast plus variants impossible to count i had fingers crossed about being able to learn that but both men assured me that they had worked out a failsafe that would get me out of a crunch if i ever had to do it alone part of the problem lay in the fact that gay deceiver was a oneman girl her doors unlocked only to her masters voice or to his thumbprint or to a tapping code if he were shy both voice and right thumb zeb tended to plan aheadoutwitting murphys law he called it anything that can go wrong will go wrong grandma called it the butterside down rule first priority was to introduce us to gay deceiverteach her that all four voices and right thumbprints were acceptable that took a couple of hours with deety helping zebbie the tapping code took even less it being based on an old military cadenceits trickiness being that a thief would be unlikely to guess that this car would open if tapped a certain way and in guessing the correct cadence zebbie called the cadence drunken soldier jacob said that it was bumboat deety claimed that its title was pay day because she had heard it from janes grandfather our men conceded that she must be right as she had words for it her words included drunken sailor instead of drunken soldierplus both pay day and bumboat introductions taken care of zeb dug out gays anatomy one volume her body one her brain he handed the latter to deety took the
