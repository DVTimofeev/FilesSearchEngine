car either holes up or crosses a state line and gets lost the party or parties who paid for the contract may be nearby but if they are hilda theyre in your house one of my guests oh shut it sharpie you are never interested in the morals of your guests if they can be depended on to throw custard pies or do impromptu strips or some other prank that will keep your party from growing dull that qualifies them however i am not assuming that the boss villain was at your party i am saying that he would not be lurking where the man might put the arm on him your house would be the best place to hide and watch the plot develop but guest or not he was someone who knew that doctor burroughs would be at your party hilda who knew that key fact she answered with uncustomary seriousness i dont know zebbie i would have to think think hard mmm not many several were invited because jake was comingyou for example i became aware of that but you werent told that jake would be present some were toldno brain for examplebut i cant imagine that old fool boobytrapping a car i cant either but killers dont look like killers they look like people how long before the party did you tell brainy that pop would be present i told him when i invited him mmm eight days ago i sighed the possibles include not only the campus but the entire globe so we must try to figure probables doctor burroughs can you think of anyone who would like to see you dead several  let me rephrase it who hates your guts so bitterly that he would not hesitate to kill your daughter as long as he got you and also bystanders such as hilda and me not that we figure save to show that he didnt give a hoot who caught it a deficient personality amoral who is he pop burroughs hesitated doctor carter disagreement between mathematicians can be extremely heated and i am not without fault youre telling me pop but these quarrels rarely result in violence even the death of archimedes was only indirectly related to hisourprofession to encompass my daughter as wellno even doctor brain much as i despise him does not fit the picture deety said zeb could it have been me they were shooting at you tell me whose dolly have you busted hmm i cant think of anyone who dislikes me even enough to snub me sounds silly but its true its the truth put in sharpie deety is just like her mother was when janedeetys mother and my best friend until we lost herwhen jane and i were roommates in college i was always getting into jams and jane was always getting me outand never got into one herself a peacemaker so is deety okay deety youre out of it so is hilda and so am i as whoever placed that booby trap could not predict that either hilda or i would be in blast range so its pop theyre gunning for who we dont know why we dont know when we figure out why well know who meantime weve got to keep pop out of range im going to marry you as fast as possible not only because you smell good but to give me a legitimate interest in this fight so we go first to reno shut up sharpie weve been on course for reno since we leveled off i flipped on the transponder but to the left not right it would now answer with a registered legal signal but not one registered to my name this cost me some shekels i did not need but were appreciated by a tightlipped family man in indio sometimes it is convenient not to be identified by sky cops every time one crosses a state line but we arent going to reno those cowboy maneuvers were intended to deceive the eye radar and heat seekers the evasion against the heat seekersthat rough turn while we were still in glideeither worked or was not needed as we havent had a missile up the tail probably wasnt needed people who boobytrap cars arent likely to be prepared to shoot a duo out of the sky but i couldnt be certain so i ducked we may be assumed to be dead in the blast and fire and that assumption may stand up until the mess has cooled down and there is daylight to work by even later it may stand up as the cops may not tell anyone that they were unable to find organic remains but i must assume that professor moriarty isnt fooled that he is watching by repeater scope in his secret hq that he knows we are headed for reno and that hostiles will greet us there so we wont go there now quiet please i must tell this baby what to do the computerpilot of my car cant cook but what she can do she does well i called for display map changed scale to include utah used the light pen to trace routecomplex as it curved around reno to the south back north again made easting over some very empty country and passed north of hill air force range in approaching logan i fed in heightaboveground while giving her leeway to smooth out bumps and added one change in speedoverground once we were clear of reno radar got it girl i asked her got it zeb tenminute call please call you ten minutes before end of routingright youre a smart girl gay boss i bet you tell that to all the girls over roger and out gay the display faded certainly i could have programmed my autopilot to accept a plan in response to a punched execute but isnt it pleasanter to be answered by a warm contralto but the smart girl aspect lay in
