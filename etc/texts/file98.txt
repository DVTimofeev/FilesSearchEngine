loves me even when im bad whos that thank you deety we love and trust each other now tell me did you ever have any intention of sleeping tonight in the car she pulled the chain again under that racket she said into my ear deety doll i never had any intention of sleeping tonight xxviii hes too fat zeb sharpie sat on the governors right with my wife on his left which gave jake and me the privilege of sharing lady herbert a loud shout away the space was filled with mess jackets dinner coats and wives in their best we each had one footman to insure that we did not starve this platoon was bossed by a butler as impressive as the pope who was aided by a squad of noncom butlers female servants rushed in and out to serving tables his supremacy the butler took it from there but used his hands only in offering splashes of wine to the governor to taste and approve all were in liverydecorated with the broad arrow the british colony consisted of a wogs b transportees c discharged transportees d officers and enlisted men e civil servants and f spouses and dependents i know even less about the russian colony military and serfs i think the ladies were in victorian highstyle dowdiness which made deety and sharpie birds of paradise among crows jump suit and sailor pants had shocked people at tea but at dinnerdeety wore the velvet wrap she had the night we eloped sharpie wore her sunsetshade mink cape jake and i unveiled them on the grand staircase leading down to the reception hall naw we didnt rehearse we were mysterious strangers guests of the governor general and his lady so all eyes were upon us maids hurrying up met us there to take our ladies wraps i had questioned the propriety of house guests coming downstairs in wraps sharpie had answered utterly correct zebbiebecause i set the style i did so this afternoon i shall until we leave i shut up sharpie has infallible instinct for upstaging have i mentioned how sharpie and deety were dressed at sharpies party they practically werent i wish i had had that hail bugged to record the gasps when jake and i uncovered our prizes these two had last been seen at tea one in a jump suit the other in an outfit that looked donated by the salvation army with no makeup we had been to our suite before tea only for a hasty wash but nowsharpie did deetys hair deety did sharpies sharpie styled both faces including too much lipstick which deety doesnt often wear i asked sharpie if she knew the history and significance of lipstick she answered certainly do zebbie dont bother us she went on making deety beautiful deety is beautiful but doesnt know it because her features have that simple regularity favored by praxiteles having put too much lipstick on deety sharpie removed some then carried her makeup onto her breasts so that it disappeared under the dress which is pretty far because they saved material on that dress at the top in order to give it a full floorlength skirt you cant quite see her nipplesin the flesh i mean they generally show through her clothes always when shes happy because deety stands tall her mother had told her deety if a woman is tall the answer is to look at least three centimeters taller than you are deety always believed her mother she stands tall sits straight she never leans or slouches she can get away with that dress by half a centimeter im not sure of the material but the color is the shade of green that goes best with strawberry hair that dress her height long legs broad shoulders a waist two sizes too small setting off breasts two sizes too bigthe combo could get her a job as a show girl when sharpie finished gilding deety i couldnt see that she had been made up at allut knew durn well that she did not look the way she had before sharpie picked her jewelry toosparingly as deety had all her pretties with her her own and those that had belonged to her mother sharpie based it on an emeraldandpearl neckpiece plus a matching pin and ring as for sharpie twice my darlings age and half as big restraint was not what she used the central diamond of her necklace was smaller than the star of africa she wore other diamonds here and there here is something i dont understand sharpie is underprivileged in mammary glands i know she was not wearing cheaters as i returned to get my tie tied just as deety was about to lower it onto her no bra no underwear but when that dress was fastened sharpie had titslittle ones but big enough for her size stuffing built into the dress nope i went out of my way to check is that why some couturiers get such high prices still the captain looks best in her skin so we uncovered these confections and gave the british colony male female and the others something to talk about for months i cant say the english ladies were pleased their men gravitated toward our darlings like iron filings toward a magnet however betty lady herbert is sweet all through she rushed toward us a bow wave of juniors getting out of her way stopped short looked only at our ladies and said with the delight of a child at christmas oh how beautiful you are and clapped her hands her voice projected against dead silence then conversation resumed lady herbert took them an arm around each and toured the hall busting up a receiving line brigadier hirdjones rolled with the punch gathered in jake and me made sure we met those who had not been at tea shortly before dinner a colonel said to me oh i say is it
