aboard and aunt hilda would not find that word in anything less than the oed copilot got it logged captain i didnt know we had a log no log even vanderdecken keeps a log deety the log falls in your department take your fathers notes get what you need from gay and lets have a taut ship first time we pass a woolworths well pick up a journal and you can transcribe itnotes taken now are your rough log aye aye sir tyrant tyrant sir please meanwhile lets share the binoculars and see if we can spot any colorful exotic natives in colorful exotic costumes singing colorful exotic songs with their colorful exotic hands out for baksheesh first one to spot evidence of intelligent life gets to wash the dishes xv well hit so hard well hardly notice it hilda i was so flattered by capn zebbies crediting me with discovering barsoom that i pretended not to understand the jibe he added it was unlikely that deety would know such a useless word or my beloved jacob it was gallant of zeb to give in all the way once he realized that this planet was unlike its analog in our universe zebbie is a funny onehe wears rudeness like a halloween mask afraid that someone will discover the galahad underneath i knew that my barsoom was not the planet of the classic romances but there are precedents the first nuclear submarine was named for an imaginary undersea vessel made famous by jules verne an aircraft carrier of the second global war had been named shangri la for a land as nonexistent as erewhon the first space freighter had been named for a starship that existed only in the hearts of its millions of fansthe list is endless nature copies art or as deety put it truth is more fantastic than reality during that hour barsoom rushed at us it began to swell and swell so rapidly that binoculars were a nuisanceand my heart swelled with it in childlike joy deety and i unstrapped so that we could see better floating just above and behind our husbands while steadying ourselves on their headrests we were seeing it in half phase one half dark the other in sunlightocher and umber and olive green and brown and all of it beautiful our pilot and copilot did not sightsee zebbie kept taking sights kept jacob busy calculating at last he said copilot if our approximations are correct at the height at which we will get our first radar range we will be only a bit over half a minute from crashing check to the accuracy of our data captain too close i dont fancy arriving like a meteor is it time to hit the panic button advise pleasebut bear in mind that puts usshould put ustwo klicks over a hot new craterossibly in the middle of a radioactive cloud ideas captain we can do that just before crashingand it either works or it doesnt if it works that radioactive cloud will have had more time to blow away if it doesnt work well hit so hard well hardly notice it gay deceiver isnt built to reenter at twentyfour klicks per second shes beefed upbut shes still a ford not a reentry vehicle captain i can try to subtract the planets orbital speed weve time to make the attempt fasten seat belts and report move it gals free fall is funny stuff i was over that deathly sicknesswas enjoying weightlessness but didnt know how to move in it nor did deety we floundered the way one does the first time on ice skatesonly worse treport damn it deety got a hand on something grabbed me we started getting into seats she in mine i in hers strapping down captain she called out while frantically trying to loosen my belts to fit her i was doing the same in reverse speed it up deety reported seat belts fastened while still getting her chest belt buckledby squeezing out all her breath i reached over and helped her loosen it copilot captain along l axis subtract vector twentyfour klicks per secondand for gods sake dont get the signs reversed i wont execute seconds later jacob reported that does it captain i hope lets check two readings ten seconds apart ill call the first you call the end of ten seconds mark zeb added one point two record after what seemed a terribly long time jacob said seven seconds eight seconds nine secondsark our men conferred then jacob said captain we are still falling too fast of course said deety weve been accelerating from gravity escape speed for mars is five klicks per second if barsoom has the same mass as mars thank you astrogator jake can you trim off uh four klicks per second sure do it uhone how does she look uhistance slowly closing hello gay howdy zeb program radar target dead ahead range no reading continue ranging report first reading add program display running radar ranges to target program running who blacked your eye youre a smart girl gay im sexy too over continue program zeb sighed then said copilot theres atmosphere down there i plan to attempt to ground comment advice captain those are words i hoped to hear lets go barsoomhere we come xvi a maiden knight eager to break a lance jake my beloved bride was no more eager than i to visit barsoom i had been afraid that our captain would do the sensible thing establish orbit take pictures then return to our own spacetime before our air was stale we were not prepared to explore strange planets gay deceiver was a bachelors sports car we had a little water less food enough air for about three hours our craft refreshed its air by the scoop method if she made a high jump her scoop valves sealed from internal pressure just as did commercial ballistichypersonic intercontinental linersbut high jump is not space
