said bingo gay bounce and a light appeared on the display he started the program and told gay to increase scale the light spread out into a circle with a lighted dot in the center captain watch this ive told gay that every stop is a bingo you may be surprised thanks zebbie the circle was becoming freckled inside its perimeter with no feeling of motion the scene flicked every second it was midmorning each scene was sharp that big building would be dead aheadblink your eye and youre staring at fieldsthen again at the city but with that building off to starboard it put me in mind of holovideo tape spliced to create confusion zebbie had on his phones and was ignoring everything else jacob was watching the flickering scenery as was i as was deetywhen jacob suddenly turned his head
