will faint how many will die of heart failure how many are you willing to kill to satisfy your curiosity i added to those people we are monsters worse than blackhat vermin oh dear youre right zebadiahdismally so lets get out of here copilot set to transit straight up one hundred thousand klicks transition h axis positive vernier setting fiveset execute i continued captain id like to sit here a while very well zebadiah sharpie lets hear your theory captain ive been scared silly by too many narrow escapes we know how to translate from one earthanalog to the next just use plenty of elbow room but these rotations are making me whitehaired the laws of chance are going to catch up with us zebbie i dont think the laws of chance have anything to do with it i dont think we have been in any danger in any rotation so sharpie im about to swap jobs with you as quickly as i can get the captains permission no no i chicken zebbie your hunches are part of why i say that the laws of chance are not relevant sharpie statistical laws are the most firmly established of all natural laws do they apply in the land of oz asked deety uh damned if i know touch zeb hilda has not expressed it as i would nevertheless i agree with her to call the equations used in statistics laws of nature is a misnomer those equations measure the degree of our ignorance when i flip a coin and say that the chance of heads or tails is fiftyfifty i am simply declaring totai ignorance as to outcome if i knew all conditions the outcome might be subject to precalculation but we have experienced two universes having physical laws unlike those of our home universe three jacob lilliput makes three i dont follow you my dear the cubesquare law that runs through all biology does not apply here a human brain cant be placed in a space the size of a thimble by our biophysical laws but were getting away from the theory zebbie wanted me to expound shall i go on yes deety ruled everybody shut up but aunt hilda im zipping my own lip hillbillyproceed all right its not chance that we have been in three universesinsideout the land of oz and lilliputin less than twentyfour hours isnt it deety less than twentyone aunt hilda thanks hon its not chance that those three are fictional universesi have to call them that for lack of a better wordwell known to each of us by coincidenceand again i dont have a good word but its not chanceall four of us are addicted to fanciful stories fantasy fairy tales we all like the same sort of stories how many of us like detective stories somenot all said deety my sole loyalty is to sherlock holmes i said waste of time said jake id like to try an experiment hilda went on write down the twenty stories you have enjoyed most or groups of related storiesthe oz books would count as one so would the edgar rice burroughs mars series and so would the four voyages of gullivers travels make them stories you reread for pleasure when you are too tired to tackle a new book sharpie is it cheating to ask how you mean to use this no zebbie if my theory is right the next time we rotate and find ourselves near a planet it will turn out to be the scene of a story or group of stories that appears on all four lists well arrive high enough that jacob will have plenty of time to level off but close enough that we can ground but we will never rotate into a mass or any danger that we cant handle this isnt chance we havent been dealing with chance the land of oz surprised me lilliput didnt surprise me at all i expected it or at least a place that all of us know through stories how about those empty universes i demanded maybe they are places about which stories will be written or maybe stories have already been told but arent favorites of us four so we dont emerge close to their scenes but those are guesses so far as my theory is concerned such universes are nullthey dont count one way or the other we find our universes sharpie you have just invented pantheistic multiperson solipsism i didnt think it was mathematically possible zeb anything is mathematically possible thanks jacob zebbie solipsism is a buzz word im saying that weve stumbled onto the door in the wall the one that leads to the land of hearts desire i dont know how and have no use for fancy rationalizations i see a pattern im not trying to explain it it just is how does that hollow world fit your theory well deety called it pellucidar it was but ive read dozens of stories about worlds underground ill bet all of us have jules verne s fowler wright h g wells c l moore lovecraft all the great masters of fantasy have taken a crack at it please can we stop talking i want all four lists before we rotate again jake changed attitude so that lilliputs planet was dead ahead and told gay to hold it there the planet looked very small as if we were a million kilometers outreasonable i decided and wrote down the dorsai yarns at last deety announced im through aunt hillbilly soon after her father handed sharpie his list dont count those ive lined out deari had trouble holding it down twenty is arbitrary jacob i can leave your extras in no dear the four i eliminated do not stand as high as the twenty i retained after some pencilchewing i announced sharpie im stuck at seventeen got a bakers dozen more in mind but no choice seventeen will do zebbieif they are your
