hills and involved with this watercoursecoursestwin canalsis new russia and that honorary englishmenusarent safe here so im going to look for the british colony it may turn out that they wont like us either but the british are strong on protocol well have a chance to speak our piece they may hang us but theyll give us a trial with wigs and robes and rules of evidence and counsel who will fight for us i hesitated one hitch colonel snotsky said there was no such country as the united states of america and i had the impression that he believed it sharpie said he did believe it capn zebbie i caught some side chatter i think we must assume that in this universe there was no american revolution so i concluded should we all be from the east coast i have a hunch that the west coast may be part russian part spanishbut not british where are we from baltimore maybe philadelphia suggestions sharpie said i have a suggestion capn zebbie science officer i like your suggestions you wont like this one when all else fails tell the truth xxi three seconds is a long time deety zebadiah is convinced that i can program anything usually i can given a large and flexible computerbut my husband expects me to manage it with gay deceiver and gay is not big she started life as an autopilot and is one mostly but gay is sweettempered and we both want to please him while he and my father were looking over the area that we thought of as russian valley or new russia he asked me to work up a program to locate the british colony in minimum time if it were in daylight if not then we would sleep near the sunrise line and find it on the new daylight side i thought of bouncing out about a thousand kilometers and searching for probable areas by color then i realized that i didnt know that much about this planet dead sea bottoms from space looked like farm land at last i recalled something zebadiah had suggested yesterdayno today less than two hours ago so much had happened that my sense of time played tricks it was still accuratebut i had to think instead of just knowing random numbers gay had plenty of them random numbers are to a computer what free will is to a human being i defined a locus for gay nothing east of where we were nothing in russian valley nothing on the dark side nothing north of  nothing south of  south yesterday i could not have told her the latter but mars has a good spin one a gyrocompass can read while we slept gay had noted that her gyrocompass did not have its axis parallel to that of this strange planet and had precessed it until it did inside that locus i told gay to take a drunkards walk any jumps that suited her a threesecond pause at each vertex and if one of us yelled bingo display latitude longitude and greenwich and log all three so we could find it again oh yesshe was to pause that three seconds exactly one minimum haboveg at each vertex i told her to run the program for one hourut that any of us could yell stop and then say continue and that would be timeout not part of the hour but i warned my shipmates that yelling stop not only slowed things but also gave russians or british or anybody a chance to shoot at us i emphasized that three seconds is a long time most people dont know it one hour three seconds for each check twelve hundred random spot checks this is not a spacefilling curve but it should locate where the british were most thickly settled if one hour did not do it ten hours certainly would without gay without her ability to do a drunkards walk we could have searched that planet for a lifetime and never found either colony it took the entire human race of our universe thirty centuries to search terra and many spots were missing until they could be photographed from space my husband said lets get this straight he bounced us four minima these subprograms gay are you listening of course are you gay go to sleep roger and out boss deety i want to make sure of these subprograms but couldnt use code words while she was awake i excuse me zebadiah but you can she will ignore code words for subprograms except while the general program is running the code for the general program is unusual and requires the execution command so it cant be started by accident you can wake gay we need her on some points youre a smart girl deety ill bet you tell that to all adequate cooks boss ouch captain it is not difficult to program a computer to supervise cooking machines the software sold under the trademark cordon bicu is reputed to be excellent reforo you wake gay would you answer a hypothetical question concerning computers and cooking captain copilot  advise against permitting the astrogator to discuss side issuessuch as cookingwhile we have this problem facing us thank you copilot astrogator what was your hypothetical question pop had been careful not to interfere between zebadiah and me but his advice from copilot to captain was intended for my earshe was telling me to shut up and i suddenly heard jane saying deety anytime a wife thinks she has won an argument she has lost it im not jane im deety i get my temper from my father im not as quick to flare up as he is but i do have his tendency to nurse a grievance zebadiah is sometimes a tease and knows how to get my goat but pop was telling me drop it deety maybe zebadiah was righttoo much argument too much discussion too much sewing
