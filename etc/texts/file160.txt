that last statementher mouth twitched in a half smile about to become i think a snicker had she not suppressed all expression no one but i caught it i made note to ask her about it laterthen i remembered what the mouse told the cat and decided not to but i do what any prudent howard does i have tissue on deposit one may do this either of two ways pay high or pay much lower and sign a release on half the donation for research and instruction he grinned im stingy my tissue is available to medical students he went on not all medical schools are ethical i can think of at least three planets where lazarus looked directly at my wife deety you raised this issue while i can think of three planets where one can buy any sort of monster i can think of at least thirty where for a much lower fee i could simply say i want that one he pointed at sharpieand the answer would be its a deal mac how freshly dead and when do you want delivery sharpie looked around behind herself as if to see at whom lazarus had pointed thats the cheapest way then you werent pointing at me sharpie interrupted woodie its not polite to point for a moment you had me worried im never cheaphighpriced always so i found out commodore deety thats cheapest and safe for the buyer in the places i have in mind but how can i convince you that i never gave even a moments consideration to that method you seem to know a lot about memore than i know about any of you is there anything that you have ever read or heard anything that ive said or done that would cause you to think that i would murder or contract for a murdersame but nastierin order to further my own ends im not saying that i have never killed a man who has lived even half as long as i have has found himself more than once in a killorbekilled situation but the best way to deal with such a situation is not to get into it anticipate it avoid it lazarus long stopped and looked sad and for the only time of my acquaintance with him looked his age i do not mean he suddenly looked decrepit but he had an aura of ancient sorrow professor burroughs if it would do any good i would junk all my plans accept being forever stranded here for the privilege of taking a twentypound sledge and smashing your spacetime twister i was shocked damn it i like good machinery jake looked hurt deety and sharpie looked stunned jake said tightly lazarus  why not to hurt you professor you have my highest respect you are one of three the man who invented the wheel the man who discovered how to use fireand you but in making this supreme discovery you have accomplished something i had thought impossible you have made interstellar war logistically practical interstellar intergalacticinteruniversal  lazarus suddenly straightened up threw off his gloom grinned all the kings horses and all the kings men cant close pandoras box again once it hits the fan the only thing to do is sweep it up package it and sell it as fertilizer hilda has plans along that line but im going to have to start thinking in military terms again figure out how to defend my home place against what appears to be that ultimate weapon much talked about but never achieved i am glad to say that hilda plans to keep it a closeheld secret as long as possible that may buy us time he turned his attention back to my wife deety i have never murdered i never will the nearest i ever came to it was once being sorely tempted to strangle a fiveyearold boy i admit that the thought has often passed through my mind that this character or that would look his best as the centerpiece of a funeral but can i convince you that i have never acted on such thoughts think hard pleaseall that you know of me am i capable of murder deety doesnt dither remember how we got married she jumped up hurried around our kitchen table and kissed lazarusand stopped hurrying it was a kiss that calls for a bed or even a pile of coalhad there not been urgent business before the house deety broke from it sat down beside him and said tell us how we get this unmurdered fresh corpse its clear that were going to have to go pick it upin gay so we must know libby said gently lazarus this is what you have been avoiding may i tell it thanks lib no you would pretty it up i pipe down said deety elizabeth give us the straight word briefly very well the medical school of bit is as ethical as you will find my sisterwife ishtar is director of the rejuvenation clinic and chairman of the board of the medical school and still finds time to teach i have never seen maureen johnson as i was born about two centuries after she was but she is supposed to resemble laz and lorunsurprising she is their genetic mother since they were cloned from lazarus oh i see there is still a third clone from lazarus female a spoiled one deety ishtar tells me that it is difficult rather than otherwise to get a bad clone from lazarene tissue so it is especially suitable for induced mutation experiments she orders the destruction of these experiments when they have served their purpose deety said to make it brief growled lazarus lib ignored him but while ishtar checks on the students no one checks on her for twenty years ishtar watched for a clone that would look human but not be human so deficient in forebrain that it could never be anything but
