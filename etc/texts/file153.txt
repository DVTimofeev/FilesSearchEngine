that what it takes no it would not be equitable and that would compel you to cheat any contract must profit both of us but rescuing your mother appeals to meto all my family im the least sentimental of usand we would tackle it if there were not a fiat dollar in sight pour le sport that nice warm feelingwhether its a kitten a baby bird or an old woman but there is money in this and sport and opportunities beyond imagination that sound of water splashing does that interfere with doras hearing no she filters it out is she listening i instantly answered yes ive lived a long time in part by being a cat not caught in the same trap twiceas she had underlined i placed in my permanent memory nine times nine never to lie to this woman again evade avoid keep silent be elsewhere but dont lie to her a born grand inquisitor telepathic must ask lazlor im glad you said yes lazarus had you said no i would have broken off negotiations im not telepathicbut you may find it inadvisable to lie to me we must change the computer situationpart now part later you didnt give her the right code words thats right chinchy and mean equal roger wilco but reversed meaning eh thats a deepdown memory yes hmm i must insert that phrase into galacta useful the water was just right with deep fragrant suds i stepped down into it picked a seat that let me lounge i should have said to dora shall i tell dora now with a modification i want the equivalent of a simple telephone so that i can call anyone anyone can call meand the same for you but kill the snoop circuits throughout this suite no trouble we can call out at any time that is a safety feature permanent as for calling in i usually limit it to the twin commanding shes entitled to disturb me if needed if not neededwell neither laz nor lor enjoys being called stupid especially by me i changed the orders to dora and did not cheat mrs burroughs and i were now truly in private although anyone could reach usvoice only what next maam some permanent changes for dora now that she cant hear us tentative plans for your mothers rescue then we talk business is there a seat in that pool where i wont drown oh certainly when lazlor were your size they often bathed with me ive had as high as six in this tub although thats a bit cozy its a fouradult design here let me help you cant see through these suds helping hilda burroughs reminded me of handling lazlor at the same size prepubescent but i was acutely aware that this small warm slick body was postpubescent by many years and i got a twinge that i was pleased to have figleafed by suds feel under youfind the seat temnerluire suit von luxurious on tertius refreshers are social rooms are they not yes over the years i have found that nude cultures or those with no taboos about nakedness tend to make bathing a social event ancient romans ancient japanese many others she answered whereas cultures with strong body taboos equate bathing rooms with outhouses back of barns disgusting mrs burroughs looked disgusted i noted this as i had thought it would be necessary to get them used to skin before exposing them to the easygoing ways of tertius lest i jeopardize my mothers rescue i had instructed lazlor to hold us in irrelevancy until all of them with no urging accepted the comfort of complete bareness in perfectly tempered conditions and simply forgot about bodies qua bodies this does not mean to forget yinyang but it has long been known to all but legislators judges and other fools that a scrap of clothing figleafing whatever may be taboo taboos vary endlessly and each is a law of nature is far more stimulating than is no clothing warning to timetravellers to assume that the taboos of your native culture are natural and that you cant go too wrong behaving by the rules your loving parents taught you is to risk death or worse if you think death has no worse read history to return to pretty little mrs burroughs to be enjoying a bath with her a few minutes after she had had me subjected to personal indignity was the second most surprising thing about her the most surprising thing i was still learning this fragile little doll with the muscles of a kitten was the toughest bitch kitty i have ever encountered understand me i admire her but i want to be on the side she is on what changes in dora do you want maam lazarus im maam to strangers and on formal occasions i dont consider bathing all that formal my friends call me hilda or by nicknames even pet names but not maam my answer got me splashed she went on in attempting to hornswoggle me you gave me through your accomplices a phony command and rank while retaining control of the computer necessary to make it real i require that you carry out your contract now by reprogramming dora to me as her sole boss with the program locked so that you cant change it me and me alone she smiled leaned toward me and placed a hand on my knee under water thats why i insisted on privacyfor doras sake shes selfaware and seems quite vulnerable lazarus i dont mind anyone in this ship hearing anything ive been saying but i dont discuss surgery when it is likely to upset the patient she leaned forward scratch between my shoulder bladespretty please i welcomed time to think while requiring her to coach mehigher lower a little to the left ah right there  hilda im not sure it can be done i did reprogram dora so that her loyalty in crisis
