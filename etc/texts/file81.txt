answered gay deceiver is that okay captain smart girl cant hear the shortform programs now until she hears her full name first then you would still have to say gay to alert her and home or whatever to scram but there should be loads of time as shell tell me if anything starts to go wrong you heard her thats fine astrogator i turned her ears off because there may be discussion in which you might not want to have to be careful to use code words but still be able to put her ears back fast if you need them faster than the switch and besides the switch can be reached only from the left front seat deety had a touch of nervous chattering i understood the reasons for each step and i understood why she was chattering well done thank you remain at the conn chief pilot copilot the secondincommand has the conn i am going aft and do not wish to be disturbed i lowered my voice spoke directly to deety you are free to call me you only aye aye captain deety acknowledged quietly i must remind you air for four hours only if i fall asleep call me in three hours i kissed her quickly floated out of my chair and started to undog the bulkhead doorgot nowhere deety had to help me deety flipped a light switch for me she closed me in and dogged one dog i got a blanket out of the cradle took off my clothes tried to wrap myself in the blanket it kept slithering away no seat belts but the web straps used to make a bedroll of zebbies sleeping bag were attached through loops and tucked under thingammies soon i had a belt across my waist and the blanket around me being a runt the only way i can fight is with words but best for me is to walk away fight with jacob i was so angry i wanted to slap him but i never slap anyone a woman who takes advantage of her size and sex to slap a man is herself no gentleman so i walked awaygot out of there before i said something that would tear itlose me my lovable cuddly thoughtfuland sometimes unbearablehusband i wept in my pillowno pillow and no kleenex after a while i slept xxv leave bad enough alone deety after i helped aunt hilda with the bulkhead door i got back into my seat and said nothing if i opened my mouth i would say too much i love pop a heap and respect him as a mathematician pop is also one of the most selfish people ive ever known doesnt mean hes tight with money he isnt doesnt mean he wouldnt share his last crust of breadhe would with a stranger but if he doesnt want to do something he wont when jane died i had tq take over money management at once at seventeen because pop ignored it it was all i could do to get him to sign his name  i was bucking for my doctorate pop seemed to think that i should cook clean house shop keep financial records manage our businesses cope with taxesand earn my doctorate simultaneously once i let dishes stack to see how long it would take him to notice about two weeks later he said deety arent you ever going to do the dishes i answered no sir eh why not i dont have
