had better i like my own rig i dont like to drive other peoples cars and while deety probably handled controls as smoothly as she danced i did not know that she didand im chicken i didnt figure her father into the equation trusting my skin to his temper did not appeal maybe deety would settle for letting him trail usbut my bridetobe was going to ride with me where over in the far corner ill unlock it and turn on the lights she reached into her fathers inside jacket pocket took out a magic wand wait for baby the shout was from our hostess hilda was running down the path from her house purse clutched in one hand and about eight thousand newdollars of sunset mink flying like a flag from the other so the discussion started over seems sharpie had decided to come along to make certain that jake behaved himself and had taken just long enough to tell max her bouncerbutlerdriver when to throw the drunks out or cover them with blankets as needed she listened to deetys summary then nodded got it i can handle yours deety jake and i will go in it you ride with zebbie dear she turned to me hold down the speed zebbie so that i can follow no tricks buster dont try to lose us or youll have cops busting out of your ears i turned my sweet innocent eyes toward her why sharpie darling you know i wouldnt do anything like that youd steal city hall if you could figure a way to carry it who dumped that load of lime jello into my swimming pool i was in africa at that time as you know so you say deety darling keep him on a short leash and dont feed him meat but marry him hes loaded now wheres that radio link and your car here said deety pointed the magic wand and pressed the switch i gathered all three into my arms and dived we hit the ground as the blast hit everything else but not us the blast shadow of other cars protected us iii professor moriarty isnt fooled zeb dont ask me how ask a trapeze artist how he does a triple sault ask a crapshooter how he knows when hes hot but dont ask me how i know its going to happen just before it hits the fan it doesnt tell me anything i dont need to know i dont know whats in a letter until i open it except the time it was a letter bomb i have no precognition for harmless events but this splitsecond knowledge when i need it has kept me alive and relatively unscarred in an era when homicide kills more people than does cancer and the favorite form of suicide is to take a rifle up some tower and keep shooting until the riot squad settles it i dont see the car around the curve on the wrong side i automatically hit the ditch when the san andreas fault cut loose i jumped out a window and was in the open when the shock arrivedand didnt know why i had jumped aside from this my esp is erratic i bought it cheap from a warsurplus outlet i sprawled with three under me i got up fast trying to avoid crushing them i gave a hand to each woman then dragged pop to his feet no one seemed damaged deety stared at the fire blazing where their
