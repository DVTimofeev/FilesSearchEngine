is probably no word for it in any language and at least two computers are full members they come and go and raise children and only the family geneticist doctor ishtar is sure of parentage and who cares i suspect that they are all ambi in sex but no outsider could guessand i am an outsider but of this i am certain when long meets long for the first time any day they kissand its no latin peck i learned that i could have anything i wanted for breakfast this should have been enough to tell me that we were being set up for the tale im getting ahead of my story as i know things about the long family that i read in a book that you may not have read this ship dora came from a planet many parsecs from the earthanalog of that universe from a time over two thousand years in my future looked at one way or a time totally irrelevant to mine through not having duration axis in common yet i could have anything post toasties hens eggs any style bacon ham sausage breakfast steak toast orange marmalade concord grape jelly buckwheat cakesand not one of these foods is from tertius home of the long family pepsodent in our fresher as i was contemplating a beautiful golden waffle with one bite of it melting in my mouth lazarus long walked innd a voice in my head played back the commodore always eats breakfast in the flag cabin add that lazarus was dressed as were zeb and i save that he did not yet have a napkin working hypothesis lazarus had listened in on every word between husband and wife second hypothesis dora tell me when they get up tell me when they arrive in the breakfast roomif they do but offer trays as usual if they eat in the breakfast room let me know how each is dressed the first hypothesis defines a grave social offense the second outlines information a host or hostess is entitled to know how do i find out which is which answer i cant as lazarus long will give me the answer that profits him and that computer is loyal to him not to me as soon as lazarus finished kissing lib long he was grabbed by deety and kissedhen he caught hildas eye glanced at me and sloooowly bent to kiss her giving her and me severally time to make that tiny gesture that says noand did kiss her because i depend on hildas instincts and will never tell her no in such circumstances or greater or lesser hilda put her hand back of his neck and thereby controlled the kiss and made it longand i tore up the first hypothesis and marked the second one qed hildas instincts about people are infallible i think she is a touch telepathic as may be we would now help him if possible to zeb and me he simply said good morninghis instincts are reputed to be infallible too i agreed that it was a good morning while noting to myself that it was a symbol without a referent save for social connotation morning in an irrelevancy but added sincerely lazarus this is the best waffle i ever tasted then please tell dora dora did you hear what i said to the commodore i surely did professor jake six more i felt my waistlinefirm and many centimeters trimmed off six more is what i want right away but half of one is all i dare eat deety the next time we go to oz will you ask glinda whether or not there is a magic for gluttonsme i meanto permit them to eat as much as they want while three fourths of it disappears im sure she could do it im equally sure that she would not shes an ethical witch you would not be able to convince her that your purpose was worthy you are depressingly logical my dear lib said professor you have actually been to the land of oz really and truly really and truly dora is gay on the line on deck jakegays voice has anyone been in to see our portside annex how could they captain hilda has not authorized it but hilda no dear sorry to be blunt commodore and

ive finished eating i accept then come along elizabeth anyone else lazarus said dora shove my breakfast to the back of the stove ill eat it later a jelly omelet ill eat it myself do that dorable captain im ready lazlor showed up together did not want to be left out we ended up quite a crowd eight humans two computers hilda stopped us at gays starboard door friends again i must be blunt as you cross the sill of that door you are leaving star yacht dora and entering an independent command the gay deceiver even though dora totally sur rounds gay inside that door i command responsible to no one unlimited in authority captain lor do you understand and agree with the legal theory captain lorelei glanced at her sister looked unhappy captain hilda i do agree therefore i cant come aboard i cant abandon my command my wife looked terribly distressed oh im sorry lazarus long interrupted captain hilda im sorry another way i dont agree with your legal theory i have had more than two thousand years more experience with law than my sister has all sorts of law in all sorts of cultures im not speaking of justice ill leave that to philosophers but i know what legal theories work with humans and what ones have been attempted then abandoned because they could not be made to work this situation is not new it
