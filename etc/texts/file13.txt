but utah state doesnt pay what harvard pays pop doesnt lack offers we like logan both the town and the civilized behavior of mormons but aunt hilda i must tell you some things the child looked worried i said deety if jacob wants me to know something hell tell me oh but he wont and i must no deety listen please when i said i do i resigned as pops manager when you said i do the load landed on you it has to be that way aunt hilda pop wont do it he has other things to think about things that take genius mama did it for years then i learned how and now its your job because it cant be farmed out do you understand accountancy well i understand it i took a course in it have to understand it or the government will skin you alive but i dont do it i have accountants for that and smart shysters to keep it inside the law would it bother you to be outside the law on taxes what heavens no but sharpie wants to stay outside of jaili detest an institutional diet youll stay out ofjail dont worry aunt hildaill teach you doubleentry bookkeeping they dont teach in school very double one set for the revenooers and another set for you and jake its that second set that worries me that one puts you in the pokey fresh air alternate wednesdays nope the second set is not on paper its in the campus computer at logan worse aunt hilda please certainly my computer address code is in the departments vault and an irs agent could get a court order it wouldnt do him any good it would spill out our first set of books while wiping every trace of the second set inconvenient but not disastrous aunt hillbilly im not a champion at anything else but im the best software artist inthe business i at your elbow until you are sure of yourself now about how pop got rich all the time hes been teaching hes also been inventing gadgetsas automatically as a hen lays eggs a better can opener a lawn irrigation system that does a better job costs less uses less water lots of things but none has his name on it and royalties trickle back in devious ways but we arent freeloaders every year pop and i study the federal budget and decide what is useful and what is sheer waste by fatarsed chairwarmers and porkbarrel raiders even before mama died we were paying more income tax than the total of pops salary and weve paid more each year while ive been running it it does take a bundle to run this country we dont begrudge money spent on roads and public health and national defense and truly useful things but weve quit paying for parasites wherever we can identify them its your job now aunt hilda if you decide that its dishonest or too risky i can cause the computer to make it all open and legal so smoothly that hankypanky would never show it would take me maybe three years and pop would pay high capital

manage too mama wasnt as poor as you thought when i was a little girl she came into a chunk from a trust her grandmother had set up she and pop gradually moved it over into my name and again avoided inheritance and estate taxes all legal as sunday school when i was eighteen i converted it into cash then caused it to disappear besides that ive been paying me a whopping salary as pops manager im not as rich as you are aunt hilda and certainly not as rich as pop but i aint hurtin zebbie may be richer than all of us you said last night that he was loaded but i didnt pay attention because i had already decided to marry him but after experiencing what sort of car he drives i realize that you werent kidding not that it matters yes it did matterit took both zebadiahs courage and gay deceivers unusual talents to save our lives you may never find out how loaded zebbie is dear some people dont let their left hands know what their right hands are doing zebbie doesnt let his thumb know what his fingers are doing deety shrugged i dont care hes kind and gentle and hes a storybook hero who saved my life and pops and yours and last night he proved to me that life is worth living when ive been
