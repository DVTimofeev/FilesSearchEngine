here eager to explain it to you scatological panhedonistic multiplied solecisms what jubal thats not what it says if you dont understand it how do you know because i understood what you said but the words dont fit well rearrange them scatological panhedonism multiple solecisms convinced to like i say different than dont talk dirty we are about to have a drink lazarus bypassed the queue they walked through a hole that suddenly dilated in the canvas then puckered tight behind them they found themselves facing a long table seated at it was a man working on a roster he did not look up simply saying stand out of my light tickets first no exceptions then name tags then see a clerk to pick your universe the complaint desk is outside ticketsyoure holding up the line snob the man looked up

gentlemen observe above me the brightly lighted true color representation of the visible spectrum from infradig to ultraviolent with each slight shading being a precise wave length further assisted by simulated fraunhofer lines representing principal inhabited planets of the explored universes while this booklet you hold in your hand is a key to identifying your wave length for example if you are french in origin you would turn alphabetically to france where the principal key dates are the conquest of gaul  bc the conversion of clovis  ad battle of tours  but as you are not french we will consider turning points in north american history                   any of these dates and many others can switch you into a different analogearth a most useful method is comparison of presidents if you happen to come from a history that includes the socalled american revolution director long will you illustrate it by naming american presidents of your first century woodrow wilsoni was named for himharding coolidge hoover roosevelt truman eisenhower kennedy kennedy kennedy kennedy kennedy kennedy which brings us to  right and tells me that you experienced the nehemiah scudder interregnum and possibly the second socalled american revolution dr harshaw did your world experience the interregnum it experienced something worse a world government to me all worlds are equally bad but it tells me where your two worlds split and here are your colors by which you can identify others of your own world if such be your wish a delegate came through earlier in which the split was in  and san
