i spell it correctly and pronounce it correctly as if spelled tit pop insists that teats are on cows not women after i started symbolic logic and information theory i became acutely conscious of precise nomenclature and tried to argue with pop pointing out that breast denoted the upper frontal torso of male and female alike that mammary gland was medical argot but teat was correct english he had slammed down a book i dont give a damn what the oxford english dictionary says as long as i am head of this house language used in it will conform to my notions of propriety i never argued such points with pop again mama and i went on calling them teats between ourselves and did not use such words in pops presence mama told me gently that logic had little to do with keeping a husband happy and that anyone who won a family argument had in fact lost it mama never argued and pop always did what she wantedif she really wanted it when at seventeen i had to grow up and try to replace her i tried to emulate her not always successfully i inherited some of pops temper some of mamas calm i try to suppress the former and cultivate the latter but im not jane im deety suddenly i wondered why i was putting on a halter the day was going to be hot while pop is so cubical about some things that he turns up at the corners skin is not one of them possibly he had been then mama had gently gotten her own way i like to be naked and usually am at snug harbor weather permitting pop is almost as casual aunt hilda was familybychoice we had often used her pool and never with suitsscreened for the

you select the proper sheaf of postulates people are not abstract symbols i could be naked with any one of them but not all three i felt a twinge that pop and aunt hilda might be in the way on my honeymoon then realized that zebadiah and i were just as much in the way on theirsand stopped worrying it would work out took one last look in the mirror saw that my scrap of halter like a good evening gown made me nakeder than skin would my nipples popped out i grinned and stuck out my tongue at them they stayed up i was happy i started to catfoot through our bedroom when i noticed
