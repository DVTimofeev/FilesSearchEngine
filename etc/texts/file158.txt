physicist speaks of photons could a mistake be made yes and would create a new universe jacob you spoke of the empty universes your family had visited one by one they fill as fictons are created she added but a mistake was not made we snatched maureen safely we ourselves create the fictionsfictonsficta that will make it real she was euphoric i attributed it to excitement over the coming adventure i was mistaken lazarus a highly competent mathematician although not the unique that jake is or libby was in this case not a calm abstractionist his mood was grim determination to win or die tryingcausing me to recall how he got his arse shot off jake turned out to be a determinist he himself being one universes prime example of utter rambunctious free will deety is a pragmatic mathematician unworried by theory oz is real she is real fictons dont interest her dont fret lazarus we can do it gay can do itand we wont do it until gay is certain of her program this discussion had started midafternoon in dora sharpie had worked out her difficulties with lazarus to my enormous relief were those two to wind up on opposite sides in anything more serious than parcheesi i yearn to be elsewheresay timbuktu under an assumed name she jake lazarus and libby were in the flag cabin arguing when sharpie had dora page deety and me there were endless matters on the agenda uncluding the preposterous notion that we four were missing howards and that lazarus was registering us as such im not sure i want to live a thousand years or even two hundred but i am sure of this a i want to live quite a piece and b i want to be alert healthy and active right up to the last not like my greatgrandfather who had to be spoonfed at a hundred and five and could not control his secretions but the howards have got that whipped you stay young as long as you wish then die by choice when you feel youve had your full run yes i was willing to be a found howard since it included deety plus little deeties ad infinitum lots of other business all of it postponed including the problem of black hats in order to deal with rescuing maureen johnson we were still discussing knotty aspects when lors voice said commodore yes captain sharpie had answered maam i hesitate to disturb you quite all right lor the captain must always be able to reach me uh maam dora told me that she was forbidden to call you she has for you a variety of new rome styles for women and men a military uniform for doctor jacob and one for doctor zebadiah and evening formals for doctor elizabeth and doctor deetyand shes not sure where to send any of them send all the clothes to the flag cabin please yes maam they should be appearing in your delivery cupboard now do you know where that is ill find it what are you and your sister wearing tonight or is it a secret its not a secret we just havent decided but there is still an hour and thirtyone minutes till dinner time enough to pick out pretty clothes or will you wear formal skin tonight that takes anywhere from two seconds to two hours does it not off sharpie used an unusually rough expression of disgust which told me that she now included lib and lazarus in her inner circle woodie do you know any exceptionally strong cuss words i detest the thought of wasting time pretending to be festive when we have so much to settle especially our procedures for maureen deety looked at libby you and i are kind o stuck with a promise too how about some new cuss words from you too deety i have no literary talent but i would like to hear some soulsoothing cussing we ought to stick with this with snacks to keep going and sleep when we must until its perfect three hours or three days or three weeks i said we shall sharpie shook her head zebbie you can skip dinner i cant lazarus should appear too he agreed im afraid i must but commodore i must advise you that your flag chief of staff should be present too for esprit de corps he cleared his throat noisily libby and jacob being passengers could skip lib shook her head deety and i made a reckless promise not being a genius myself its kind of fun to make a roomful of em look silly i stood up no we will not let a dinner party interfere we can settle it within three days but if you all are going to chase rabbits whats the matter with you sharpie getting stupid in your old age apparently i am zebbie she said to lazarus please issue orders cancelling dinner well stay with this until we finish it there are beds and lounges whenever anyone needs to nap but we wont adjourn three hours or three weeks or longer dont cancel dinner sharpie zebbie you have me confused beulahland is on a different time axis five minutes later we were in our old farmhouse we hadnt stopped for clothes as we would have wasted twenty minutes whereas the idea was to save time on that axis use time on this axis we stuck lazarus and libby back in the after space with the bulkhead door dogged open so they could see and hear but required them to use the web straps and cautioned them that the lumps under them were loaded firearms the only thing not routine was that we would be making rendezvous later with a moving ship something we had done before only from bounce range in the same spacetime so i had asked gay whether she was sure she could do it she assured me that she could because
