other into our basement the next two days were easy for me hard for deety i held lights and made notes on a clip board while she studied that book and frowned and got smudged and sweaty getting herself into impossible positions and once she cursed in a fashion that would have caused jane to scold she added aunt nanny goat your stepsoninlaw has done things to this mass of spaghetti that no decent computer should put up with its a bastard hybrid you shouldnt call gay it deety and shes not a bastard she cant hear us ive got her ears unhookedexcept that piece that is monitoring news retrieval programsand that goes through this wire to that jack in the wall she can talk with zebadiah only in the basement now oh im sure she was a nice girl until that big ape of mine raped her aunt hilda dont worry about hurting gays feelings she hasnt any this is an idiot as computers go any onehorse college and most high schools own or share time in computers much more complex this one is primarily cybernetics an autopilot plus limited digital capacity and limited storage but the mods zebadiah has tacked on make it more than an autopilot but not a generalpurpose computer a misbegotten hybrid it has far more randomnumber options than it needs and it has extra functions that ibm never dreamed of deety why are you taking off cover plates i thought you were strictly a programmer software not a mechanic i am strictly a software mathematician i wouldnt attempt to modify this monster even on written orders from my lovable but sneaky husband but how in the name of allah can a software hack think about simplification analysis for program if she doesnt know the circuitry the first half of this book shows what this autopilot was manufactured to do and the second half the xeroxed pages show the follies zebadiah has seduced her into this bleedin bundle of chips now speaks three logic languages interfacedwhen it was built to use only one but it wont accept any of them until it has been wheedled with zebadiahs double talk even then it rarely answers a code phrase with the same answer twice in a row what does it say in answer to youre a smart girl gay i remember boss i bet you tell that to all the girls over sometimes oftenest as that answer is weighted to come up three times as often as any of the others but listen to this zeb im so smart i scare myself then why did you turn me down for that raise never mind the compliments take your hand off my knee not so loud dear i dont want my boyfriend to hear and there are more there are at least four answers to any of zebadiahs code phrases he uses just one list but the autopilot answers several ways for each of his phrasesand all any of them mean is either roger or null program rephrase i like the idea fun well i do myself i animize a computer i think of them as peoplend this semirandom answer list makes gay deceiver feel much more alivehen she isnt not even versatile compared with a groundbased computer but deety gave a quick smile im going to hand my husband some surprises how deety you know how he says good morning gay how are you when we sit down for breakfast yes i like it friendly she usually answers im fine zeb yes its a test code it orders the autopilot to run a selfcheck throughout and to report any running instruction which takes less than a millisecond if he didnt get that or an equivalent answer he would rush straight here to find out whats wrong but im going to add another answer or more i thought you refused to modify anything aunt hillbilly this is software not hardware im authorized and directed to amplify the answers to include all of us by name for each of our voices that is programming elementary you say good morning to this gadget and it willwhen im finishedanswer you and call you either hilda or mrs burroughs oh let her call me hilda all right but let her call you mrs burroughs now and then for variety well all right keep her a personality i could even have her call youlow weightingnanny goat i guffawed do deety please do but i want to be around to see jacobs face you will be it wont be programmed to answer that way to any voice but yours just dont say good morning gay unless pop is listening but heres one for my husband zebadiah says good morning gay how are youand the speaker answers im fine zeb but your fly is unzipped and your eyes are bloodshot are you hung over again deety is so solemn and yet playful do it dear poor zebbiewho drinks least of any of us but he might not be wearing anything zippered zebadiah always wears something at meals even his underwear shorts are zippered he dislikes elastic but hell recognize your voice deety nope because it will be your voicemodified and it was im contralto about the range of the actressor girl friend who recorded gay deceivers voice originally i dont think my voice has her sultry bedroom quality but im a natural mimic deety borrowed a wigglescopeoscilloscopefrom her father my jacob and i practiced until my patterns for gay deceivers original repertoire matched hers well enough deety said she could not tell them apart without close checking i got into the spirit of it such as having deety cause gay deceiver occasionally to say to my husband fineexcept for my back ache you wicked old billy goatand jacob tripped that reply one morning when i did have a back ache and i feel sure he had one too we didnt put in answers that deety
