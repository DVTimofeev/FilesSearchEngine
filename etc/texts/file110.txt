do it he stared at me lips moving slightly at last he said chief pilot captain you are ordered to correct me when i make a mistake twentyfour permutations certainly sir may the chief pilot have more information before she answers rogerwilco fire away captain what categories of mistakes eh any sort a mistake is a mistake daughter are you baiting me no captain i am unable to acknowledge your order as i do not understand it a mistake is a mistake is semantically null if i see you about to sugar your coffee twice shall i tell me of course if i see you treating your wife unjustly shall i wait a moment even if i did or havewhich i decline to stipulateit is not proper for you to interfere yes sir weve established that there are two sets but the captain has not defined the sets and the chief pilot lacks authority to do so may i respectfully suggest that the captain take notice of the quandary then reframe the order at a time of his choosing and in the meantime permit the chief pilot not to correct the captains mistakes zebadiah winked at me with his head turned so that i saw it but pop could not pop fumed complaining that i wasnt showing common sense and worse i had broken his train of thought he finally got around to a definition at about th grade level i was to correct him only in errors involving figures or related symbols such as angles on your own head be it pop i gave him rogerwilco in fact he went on expansively it may be my duty to see that this training course is completed before with great relief i turn this seat over to my successor i started figuring how many children i would have by then and decided to look for ways to hike up the white mutiny captain astrogator this advice concerns a mistake that could occur in the near future i assume that the captain has the conn hilda i have the conn speak up we are falling sir i advise placing us in orbit i sighed with relief as radar distance i was beginning to think of as haboveg and did not like our closing rate pop said surely put us in orbit take the conn and do it good practice deety can show you how or zeb aye aye sir i have the conn chief pilot keep her level with respect to planet roger level now copilot add speed vector positive axis l three point six klicks per second uh set hold it pop unbelted steadied himself by zebadiahs chair checked the setting okay execute excuse me captain zebadiah said but was that order directed at me or the astrogator pop opened his mouththen turned red astrogator i am satisfied with your solution and the setting please have the maneuver executed aye aye sir execute what pop planned seemed reasonable so far we have used juice supplies and four days time and have merely established that there are at least two analogs of our universe one quantum and ten quanta away on tau axis the latter has beastswogsthat are not the vermin we fled from butaccording to hildaclosely related to me this makes tau axis not our best place to seek a new home zebadiah has suggested that we sample the universes available by rotation rather than translationsix axes taken four at a timebefore we search teh axis let me remind you that we could die of old age searching teh axis alone i will decide but i will listen to arguments pro or con twentythree minutes later aunt hilda shrilled copilot by plan as set rotate xxx difference physical laws a different topology jacob we rotated to nowhere so it seemed free fall and utter blackness the cabin held only the faint radiance from the instruments my daughter said in hushed tones captain may i turn on inside lights this was a time to establish discipline and doctrine permission refused copilot i would like to see in all directions yes sir zeb acknowledged after a few moments i added copilot why are you waiting i am awaiting orders sir what the hell zeb get with it i said i wanted to see in all directions we have preprograms for that yes captain well why arent you using them cant you carry out orders i was amazed at zeb captain i have not as yet received any orders and i am not at the conn i started to answer sharplyand bit down on it precisely what had i said i recalled that the autopilot stayed in recording mode during maneuvers i could play back the last few minutes and decided not to we were wasting time and it was possible that i had not expressed myself in the form of a direct order nevertheless i could not ignore zebs pigheaded behavior copilot i am aware that i have not given you direct orders however it is customary to treat a captains requests as politely worded orders yes sir well god damn it why dont captain captain jacob please listen please i took a deep breath what is it hilda captain i am required to advise you eh advise awaybut be quick about it captain you have given the copilot neither orders nor requests the autopilots record will confirm this you mentioned preprogramsbut voice programs are not normally handled by the copilot i can order the copilot to use a voice program hilda did not answer again i waited then said well then i said astrogator you did not answer me sorry captain answer what my question captain i was not aware that you had asked me a question would you mind repeating it oh forget it forget it chief pilot captain deety whats the voice program to rotate us a full circle around w axis shall i spell it sir sg is awake
